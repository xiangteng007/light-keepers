# Scale Validator - Hormozi 10x Stress Test

Stress-test business models by imagining 10x growth and asking: "What breaks?"

**Hormozi's Core Principle:** "A business model is only as good as its constraints allow."

## When This Activates

- User asks "can this scale"
- User asks "validate my business model"
- User asks "what's my bottleneck"
- User says "I'm stuck at [revenue]"
- User asks "how do I grow beyond [number]"
- User mentions hitting a ceiling

## The Framework

**Core Question:**

```
If you 10x'd your business tomorrow, what breaks first?
```

### Four Leverage Types

| Leverage | Description | Scale Factor |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Labor | Other people's work | Low |
| Capital | Other people's money | Medium |
| Code/Media | Software/content 24/7 | High |
| Products | Standardized offerings | Highest |

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Time Independence | 2x | Can it run without you? |
| Unit Economics | 2x | Do the numbers work at scale? |
| Bottleneck Clarity | 1.5x | Do you know what's constraining? |
| Leverage Active | 1x | How many leverage types? |
| Delivery Scalability | 1.5x | Can you deliver 10x without 10x cost? |
| Margin Integrity | 1x | Do margins hold at scale? |

**Max Score:** 100 points

### Rating Scale

| Score | Rating | Verdict |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 85-100 | Scale-Ready | Pour fuel on fire |
| 70-84 | Strong Foundation | Fix weak points first |
| 55-69 | Fixable | Address constraints first |
| 40-54 | Risky | Major issues to fix |
| 0-39 | Broken Model | Rebuild fundamentals |

## Common Bottlenecks

| Type | Signs | Solution |
|------|-------|----------|
| Lead Gen | Not enough qualified leads | Optimize acquisition |
| Sales | Leads not converting | Improve sales process |
| Delivery | Can't fulfill demand | Systematize/delegate |
| Cash | Can't afford to grow | Improve margins/capital |
| Time | Founder maxed out | Delegate/hire |
