# Task & PRD Creator

## Overview

Create structured task files and PRDs before implementing features. This ensures proper planning, documentation, and clear scope definition.

**CRITICAL RULE:** Never implement a feature without first creating the task + PRD files and getting user approval.

## When This Activates

- "I want to add [feature]"
- "Implement [feature]"
- "Create a task for [feature]"
- "Plan this feature"
- User describes a user story
- Bug that needs tracking

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Request

- **Simple task:** <1 hour, few files
- **Complex feature:** >1 hour, multiple files/systems

### Step 2: Gather Requirements

- Which app/project?
- Priority? (CRITICAL/High/Medium/Low)
- Dependencies?

### Step 3: Check Existing System

- Read architecture docs
- Search for similar implementations

### Step 4: Create Files

**Task file:** `[project]/.agents/TASKS/[task-name].md`
**PRD file:** `[project]/.agents/PRDS/[task-name].md`

### Step 5: Get Approval

Present files, explain approach, **WAIT for user approval**.

## Task File Format

```markdown
## Task: [Feature Name]

**ID:** feature-name-slug
**Label:** [App]: [Feature Name]
**Description:** Brief description
**Type:** Feature | Bug | Enhancement
**Status:** Backlog | To Do | Testing | Done
**Priority:** High | Medium | Low
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**PRD:** [Link](../PRDS/feature-name.md)
```

## Critical Rules

1. Create task file
2. Create PRD file
3. Link them together
4. Present to user
5. Get approval
6. Then implement

## Red Flags (Stop and Ask)

- Breaking changes
- Affects multiple projects
- Security implications
- Unclear requirements

## Integration

- `mvp-architect` - MVP scoping
- `planning-assistant` - Content planning
- `agent-folder-init` - Initialize .agents/ structure
