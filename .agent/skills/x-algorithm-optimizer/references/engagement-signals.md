# X Algorithm Engagement Signals - Deep Dive

Detailed tactics for optimizing each of the 15 engagement signals predicted by X's Grok-based algorithm.

## Understanding the Algorithm

X's recommendation system uses transformer models (Grok) to predict user-specific engagement probability across 15 signals. Unlike older algorithms that relied on hand-crafted features, this is pure ML prediction trained on actual user behavior.

**Key Insight:** The algorithm optimizes for individual user relevance, not broad popularity. A tweet with 100 likes from your target audience scores better than 1000 likes from random users.

## Positive Signals - Deep Tactics

### 1. Favorites (Likes)

**Algorithm Weight:** High
**What It Signals:** User found content valuable enough to acknowledge

**Optimization Tactics:**

**Relatable Struggles**

```
Every founder knows this feeling:

You wake up at 3am.
Check your metrics.
Nothing changed.

Then you remember why you started.

That's the game.
```

**"Finally Someone Said It" Content**

```
Unpopular opinion:

"Growth hacking" is usually just "being annoying at scale."

Good products grow from genuine value, not tricks.
```

**Save-Worthy Resources**

```
The only 5 metrics early-stage founders should track:

1. MRR (are you making money?)
2. Churn (are they staying?)
3. CAC (what does a customer cost?)
4. Activation rate (do they get value?)
5. NPS (would they recommend you?)

Everything else is vanity.

### 3. Reposts (Retweets)

**Algorithm Weight:** Very High
**What It Signals:** Content valuable enough to share with their audience

**Optimization Tactics:**

**Frameworks with Names**

```
The ICE Framework for prioritizing features:

Impact - How much will this move the needle?
Confidence - How sure are you it'll work?
Ease - How quickly can you ship it?

Score each 1-10. Multiply. Ship the highest score first.

Works every time.
```

**Cheat Sheets**

```
Pricing psychology cheat sheet:

$99 vs $100 - "charm pricing" (works)
"Was $200" - anchoring (works)
3 tiers - decoy effect (works)
"Most popular" - social proof (works)
Ending in 7 - outdated (doesn't work)

Save this.
```

**Tools and Resources**

```

### 4. Quotes

**Algorithm Weight:** High
**What It Signals:** Content sparked commentary/extension

**Optimization Tactics:**

**Intentionally Incomplete Takes**

```
The real reason most startups fail isn't product-market fit.

It's founder-market fit.

But nobody wants to talk about that.
```

**Statements Begging for Addition**

```
Hot take:

The best time to raise money was 2021.

The second best time is never.
```

**Controversial Comparisons**

```
Unpopular opinion:

A $50k/year solo business > $5M VC-backed startup

Fight me.
```

**Optimization Tactics:**

**Complete Playbooks**

```
The complete cold email playbook (saved you $500):

Subject line formula:
"Quick question about [company]"

Opening:
"Saw [specific thing about them]. Impressive."

Pitch:
"We help [their type] do [outcome]. Recently helped [similar company] achieve [specific result]."

Ask:
"Worth a 15-min chat?"

Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am.
```

**Reference Material**

```
Every business model explained in one tweet:

- SaaS: Rent software
- Marketplace: Connect buyers/sellers, take cut
- Media: Attention for ads
- E-commerce: Sell products

Pick one. Master it.

### 7. Video Views

**Algorithm Weight:** Medium
**What It Signals:** Video content engaged users

**Optimization Tactics:**

- Hook in first 1-3 seconds (no logos, no intros)
- Text overlay for muted viewers
- Face in thumbnail increases clicks
- Keep under 2 minutes for casual content
- End with clear CTA

**Hook Examples:**

- "Stop making this mistake..."
- "This changed everything..."
- "Nobody talks about this..."

---

### 8. Photo Expansions

**Algorithm Weight:** Medium
**What It Signals:** Visual content sparked curiosity

**Optimization Tactics:**

- Crop images to create curiosity
- Use charts/data visualizations
- Screenshots of results/proof
- Before/after comparisons
- Text-heavy images with key insight partially visible

### 9. Dwell Time

**Algorithm Weight:** Very High
**What It Signals:** User spent time consuming content

**Optimization Tactics:**

**Formatting for Readability**

```
Most founders think they need more traffic.

Wrong.

Here's what they actually need:

1. Better positioning
2. Clearer messaging
3. Stronger offers

Traffic to a broken funnel = wasted money.

Fix the foundation first.

Then scale.
```

**Strategic Line Breaks**

- One thought per line
- White space creates pause
- Short paragraphs only
- Numbers and lists break monotony

**Open Loops**

```
The #1 reason your landing page doesn't convert:

It's not the copy.
It's not the design.
It's not even the offer.

It's something most people never think about...

## Signal Combinations

The most viral content hits multiple positive signals simultaneously:

### High-Engagement Formula

```
Hook (Dwell Time) +
Controversial Take (Quotes) +
Valuable Framework (Reposts) +
Question Ending (Replies) +
Credibility Signal (Profile Clicks)
```

**Example:**

```
After 10 years in startups, I've realized:

The best founders aren't the smartest.
They're the most adaptable.

Here's the framework I use to adapt fast:

1. Weekly experiment reviews
2. Kill features that don't move metrics
3. Double down on what works
4. Ignore advice from non-customers

The market is the only honest feedback.

What's your adaptation framework?
```

This tweet targets:

- Dwell time (formatting, length)
- Reposts (framework)
- Replies (question ending)
- Profile clicks (credibility)
- Favorites (relatable insight)

## Testing & Iteration

### A/B Testing Approach

1. Test one variable at a time
2. Same content, different hooks
3. Different posting times
4. With/without images
5. Track engagement rate, not just totals

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Formula | Good Benchmark |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Engagement Rate | (Likes + Replies + Reposts) / Impressions | >2% |
| Reply Ratio | Replies / Likes | >0.1 |
| Repost Ratio | Reposts / Likes | >0.1 |
| Profile Click Rate | Profile Clicks / Impressions | >0.5% |

### Iteration Loop

1. Post content with intentional signal targeting
2. Measure which signals fired
3. Analyze what worked/didn't
4. Adjust formula
5. Repeat
