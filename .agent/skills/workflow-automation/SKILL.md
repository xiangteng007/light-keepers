# Content Workflow Automation

## Overview

This skill enables Claude to help users design and implement content workflows, create process documentation, suggest automation rules, document approval processes, and optimize content pipelines for efficiency and quality.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates automatically when users:

- Ask about workflow design or content processes
- Need help documenting content workflows
- Request automation suggestions or implementation
- Want to design approval workflows
- Need content pipeline optimization
- Ask about process improvement or efficiency

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Design Content Workflows

To design effective content workflows:

1. **Understand Current Process**

   - Map existing content creation process
   - Identify workflow steps and stakeholders
   - Document current pain points and bottlenecks

2. **Design Optimal Workflow**

   - Create workflow structure: Input → Processing → Output
   - Define workflow steps and decision points
   - Identify automation opportunities
   - Design workflow for efficiency and quality

3. **Document Workflow**
   - Create visual workflow diagrams
   - Document step-by-step procedures
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Specify tools and integrations needed

**Example User Request:**
"Design a content workflow for my team that includes approval steps"

**Integration (discover from project):**

- Content Management Platform: Store workflow documentation
- Publishing Platform: Implement workflow automation
- Content Creation Tools: Integrate workflow steps into content generation

### 2. Create Process Documentation

To create comprehensive process documentation:

1. **Document Content Processes**

   - Content creation process
   - Content approval process
   - Content publishing process
   - Content optimization process

2. **Create Visual Flowcharts**

   - Convert written procedures into flowcharts
   - Visualize complex processes
   - Make processes easier to follow and share

3. **Maintain Documentation**
   - Keep documentation up-to-date
   - Version control for process changes
   - Share documentation with team

**Example User Request:**
"Create a flowchart for my content creation process"

**Integration (discover from project):**

- Content Management Platform: Store process documentation
- Team collaboration features: Share workflows with team

### 3. Automation Rule Suggestions

To suggest and implement automation rules:

1. **Identify Automation Opportunities**

   - Review workflow for repetitive tasks
   - Identify manual steps that can be automated
   - Assess automation feasibility and impact

2. **Design Automation Rules**

   - Define trigger conditions
   - Specify automation actions
   - Design error handling and fallbacks

3. **Implement Automation**
   - Configure automation rules in content platform (discover from project)
   - Test automation workflows
   - Monitor automation performance

**Example User Request:**
"What parts of my content workflow can be automated?"

**Integration (discover from project):**

- Publishing Platform: Automated scheduling and distribution
- Content Management Platform: Automated content organization
- Analytics Platform: Automated report generation

### 4. Approval Process Design

To design content approval workflows:

1. **Define Approval Requirements**

   - Identify approval stakeholders
   - Define approval criteria
   - Specify approval workflow steps

2. **Design Approval Workflow**

   - Create approval process structure
   - Define roles and permissions
   - Design approval notifications and reminders

3. **Implement Approval System**
   - Configure approval workflow in content platform (discover from project)
   - Set up notifications and alerts
   - Track approval status and history

**Example User Request:**
"Design an approval workflow where content needs manager approval before publishing"

**Integration (discover from project):**

- Content Management Platform: Approval workflow management
- Mobile App: Approval notifications and actions
- Publishing Platform: Approval-gated publishing

### 5. Content Pipeline Optimization

To optimize content pipelines for efficiency:

1. **Analyze Current Pipeline**

   - Map content pipeline from ideation to publishing
   - Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
   - Measure pipeline performance metrics

2. **Optimize Pipeline**

   - Remove unnecessary steps
   - Parallelize independent tasks
   - Automate repetitive processes
   - Optimize resource allocation

3. **Monitor and Improve**
   - Track pipeline performance
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Continuously improve workflow efficiency

**Example User Request:**
"Help me optimize my content pipeline to reduce time from ideation to publishing"

**Integration (discover from project):**

- All Platforms: Optimize workflows across platform
- Analytics Platform: Track pipeline performance metrics
- Content Management Platform: Monitor workflow efficiency

## Project Context Discovery

**Before designing workflows, discover the project's context:**

1. **Scan Project Documentation:**
   - Check `.agents/SYSTEM/ARCHITECTURE.md` for workflow architecture
   - Review `.agents/SOP/` for existing process documentation
   - Look for workflow diagrams or process maps

2. **Identify Workflow Components:**
   - Scan codebase for content creation tools
   - Look for publishing/distribution systems
   - Check for analytics integrations
   - Review approval/notification systems

**Common Content Workflow:**

```
Trend Detection (Extension) → Content Generation (Creation Tools) →
Distribution (Publishing Platform) → Analytics (Analytics Platform) → Optimization
```

**Workflow Components:**

- Browser Extension: Trend discovery and bookmarking
- Content Creation Tools: AI content generation
- Publishing Platform: Multi-platform scheduling and distribution
- Analytics Platform: Performance tracking and reporting
- Content Management Platform: Content library and organization

**Automation Opportunities:**

- Automated content scheduling
- Automated analytics refresh (cron job)
- Automated report generation
- Automated content organization
- Automated approval notifications

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic workflows and add complexity gradually
2. **Document Everything**: Maintain clear documentation for all workflows
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test automation rules before full implementation
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track workflow efficiency and optimize continuously
5. **User-Centric Design**: Design workflows that serve users, not just automate tasks
