## The Fundraising Reality Check

1. **Would you invest?** If you had $500K, would you put it in your company?
2. **Is now the time?** Or would 6 more months of growth make this easier?
3. **Do you need VC?** Would bootstrapping or a small angel round work?
4. **Can you handle rejection?** You'll hear "no" 50+ times.
5. **Is your story compelling?** Would a stranger want to hear more?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Raising too early:** No traction = hard raise
2. **Wrong investors:** Targeting VCs for a $300K raise
3. **No warm intros:** Relying only on cold outreach
4. **Slow process:** Taking 6+ months drains energy
5. **Bad terms:** Accepting terms you'll regret
6. **No momentum:** Talking to investors one at a time
7. **Overvaluing:** High valuation = harder raise
8. **Underprepared:** Not knowing your numbers cold
9. **Ignoring nos:** Not learning from rejections
10. **Celebrating too early:** Deal isn't done until money is in bank

## The "First 48 Hours" Rule

After every investor meeting:

1. **Within 2 hours:** Send thank you email
2. **Within 24 hours:** Send any requested materials
3. **Within 48 hours:** Follow up with next steps

Speed signals seriousness.
