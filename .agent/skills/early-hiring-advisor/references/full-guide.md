# Early Hiring Advisor - Full Guide

## The Framework: Early Team Building Stack

```
+----------------------------------------+
|         CULTURE & VALUES                |
|    (What you hire for)                  |
+----------------------------------------+
|         COMPENSATION                    |
|    (What you offer)                     |
+----------------------------------------+
|         TIMING                          |
|    (When to hire)                       |
+----------------------------------------+
|         ROLE PRIORITIZATION             |
|    (What to hire for first)             |
+----------------------------------------+
```

Work from bottom up. Prioritize roles first, then timing, then comp, then culture fit.

## Detailed Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Hiring Readiness Assessment

| Criterion | Status | If No |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PMF signal | [Y/N] | Wait until you have early traction |
| 18+ months runway | [Y/N] | Extend runway first |
| Clear scope of work | [Y/N] | Define before hiring |
| Tried it yourself | [Y/N] | Do it first to understand it |
| Time to manage | [Y/N] | Founders must manage early hires |

**If 2+ "No":** Consider waiting or outsourcing instead.

### Step 2: Role Impact Matrix

| Potential Role | Revenue Impact | Founder Time Saved | Urgency | Difficulty to Hire |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| [Role 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] |
| [Role 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] |
| [Role 3] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] |

**Scoring:** H=3, M=2, L=1. Add first 3 columns, subtract difficulty.
**Hire the highest score first.**

**Common First Hires by Company Type:**

| Company Type | First Hire | Second Hire | Third Hire |
|--------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Technical founders, B2B** | Sales/BD | Customer Success | Marketing |
| **Technical founders, B2C** | Growth/Marketing | Designer | Community |
| **Non-technical founder** | Technical Co-founder/CTO | Designer | Sales |
| **Solo technical** | Designer | Ops/Admin | Sales |
| **Sales-heavy product** | Sales | Customer Success | Ops |

### Step 3: Hire vs. Outsource Framework

| Factor | Hire FT | Contract/Agency | Outsource |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Core to product | Y | | |
| Ongoing 20+ hrs/week | Y | | |
| Needs deep context | Y | Y | |
| Short-term project | | Y | |
| Specialized skill (one-time) | | Y | Y |
| Admin/Operations | | | Y |
| Cost sensitive | | | Y |

**Common Outsource-First Roles:**

- Legal (use a startup lawyer)
- Accounting (use a startup bookkeeper)
- PR (project-based)
- Recruiting (contingent recruiters)
- Design (can be, early on)
- Content writing (can be, early on)

**Always Hire (Don't Outsource):**

- Core engineering (your product)
- Sales (if sales-driven)
- Customer success (customer relationships)

### Step 4: Compensation Ranges by Stage

| Role | Pre-seed Cash | Seed Cash | Equity (First 10) |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Engineer | $80K-120K | $100K-150K | 0.5%-2% |
| Designer | $70K-100K | $90K-130K | 0.25%-1% |
| Sales | $60K-80K + comm | $80K-120K + comm | 0.25%-1% |
| Marketing | $60K-90K | $80K-120K | 0.25%-0.75% |
| Ops/Admin | $50K-70K | $60K-90K | 0.1%-0.5% |

**The Compensation Conversation:**

```
"We're offering a package of $[X] base salary plus [Y]% equity.

The cash is below market because we're early stage, but the
equity represents real upside. At a $[Z]M exit, your stake
would be worth $[calculated value].

We also offer [benefits: flexibility, learning, impact, etc.]"
```

### Step 5: Equity Allocation Guidelines

| Hire # | Role Level | Typical Range |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Senior/Lead | 1-2% |
| 3-5 | Senior | 0.5-1% |
| 6-10 | Mid-Senior | 0.25-0.75% |
| 11-20 | Mid | 0.1-0.5% |
| 21-50 | Junior-Mid | 0.05-0.25% |
| 50+ | Entry-Junior | 0.01-0.1% |

**First Engineer Equity:**

- First engineer (pre-seed): 1-3%
- First engineer (seed): 0.5-1.5%

**Vesting Standard:**

- 4 years total
- 1 year cliff (25% vests at 12 months)
- Monthly vesting thereafter

### Step 6: Channel Effectiveness

| Channel | Quality | Volume | Cost | Best For |
|---------|---------|--------|------|----------|
| **Personal network** | Highest | Low | Free | First 3-5 hires |
| **Investor intros** | High | Low | Free | Senior hires |
| **Advisor intros** | High | Low | Free | Specialized roles |
| **Warm outreach** | High | Medium | Time | Specific people |
| **Communities** | Medium-High | Medium | Free/Time | Culture fit |
| **Job boards** | Medium | High | $ | Volume roles |
| **Recruiters** | Medium | High | $$$ | When desperate |

**Where Early-Stage Talent Hangs Out:**

- Twitter/X (tech, startup folks)
- LinkedIn (professionals)
- Slack communities (industry-specific)
- Discord servers (technical roles)
- Indie Hackers (startup-minded)
- YC Work at a Startup
- AngelList/Wellfound
- Local startup events

### Step 7: Interview Framework

| Round | Focus | Questions |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Screen** | Basic fit | Background, interest, availability |
| **Skills** | Can they do the job | Technical/role assessment |
| **Values** | Culture fit | How they work, what they value |
| **Founder** | Mutual fit | Vision alignment, working style |
| **Reference** | Validation | Past performance, red flags |

**Early-Stage Fit Questions:**

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| "Tell me about a time you had to figure something out with no guidance" | Self-direction |
| "What would you do in your first week?" | Initiative |
| "What's a time you did something outside your job description?" | Flexibility |
| "How do you handle ambiguity?" | Comfort with uncertainty |
| "Why a startup vs. big company?" | Motivation fit |
| "What would make you leave in 6 months?" | Risk factors |

**Red Flags for Early Hires:**

- Needs detailed job descriptions
- Can't handle ambiguity
- Optimizing for title/salary over impact
- No startup experience (and risk-averse)
- Won't do tasks "below" them
- Needs lots of structure/process

### Step 8: Offer Framework

| Component | Your Offer |
|-----------|------------|
| Role/Title | [Title] |
| Base Salary | $[X]/year |
| Equity | [X]% (options) |
| Vesting | 4 years, 1-year cliff |
| Start Date | [Date] |
| Benefits | [Health, equipment, etc.] |

**Offer Call Script:**

```
"[Name], we'd like to offer you the [Role] position.

We're excited about what you'd bring, especially [specific strength].

The offer is:
- Base salary of $[X]
- [Y]% equity, vesting over 4 years with a 1-year cliff
- [Benefits]
- Start date of [date]

Do you have any questions? What are your thoughts?"
```

**Handling Negotiation:**

| If They Ask For | Response |
|-----------------|----------|
| More cash | "Cash is tight, but we can discuss more equity" |
| More equity | "We have some flexibility here—what were you thinking?" |
| Better title | "Titles are less meaningful at our stage, but we can discuss" |
| Signing bonus | "We can't do a bonus, but could accelerate vesting" |

### Step 9: 30-Day Onboarding Plan

| Week | Focus | Outcomes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Week 1** | Context & Relationships | Meet team, understand product, read docs |
| **Week 2** | Quick Win | Ship something small, feel impact |
| **Week 3** | Dig In | Take ownership of an area |
| **Week 4** | Independence | Working autonomously, aligned |

**Onboarding Checklist:**

- [ ] Equipment and accounts set up
- [ ] Added to all communication channels
- [ ] Met every team member
- [ ] Understands product and customers
- [ ] Knows company goals and priorities
- [ ] Has clear 30-day objectives
- [ ] Has a go-to person for questions
- [ ] Had 1-on-1 with founder(s)

## The "Too Early to Hire" Warning Signs

Don't hire if:

- You don't know exactly what they'll do in week 1
- You haven't done the job yourself first
- You can't afford them for 18+ months
- You don't have time to manage them
- You're hiring to "figure it out"
- You haven't tried contractors/outsourcing first

## The "First 10 Rule"

Your first 10 hires:

- **Shape your culture** — they ARE the culture
- **Set quality bar** — you get what you hire
- **Define work ethic** — their habits become norms
- **Build or break speed** — great hires accelerate everything

Hire slowly. Fire quickly (if not working). The cost of a bad early hire is immense.
