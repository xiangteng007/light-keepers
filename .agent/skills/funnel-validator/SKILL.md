# Funnel Validator - DotCom Secrets Scorecard

## Overview

Ruthlessly assess existing funnels against Russell Brunson's DotCom Secrets framework. Score objectively, expose conversion killers, prescribe actionable fixes.

**Brunson's Core Principle:** "You're one funnel away from changing your life."

## When This Activates

- "validate my funnel" / "rate my funnel"
- "is my funnel good"
- "why isn't my funnel converting"
- Checking funnel before driving traffic
- Low conversion rates on landing pages
- Optimizing existing funnel

## Key Difference from funnel-architect

- **funnel-architect:** Designing funnels from scratch
- **funnel-validator:** Assessing existing funnels, scoring, fixing

## The Framework: DotCom Secrets Scorecard

```
HOOK (Grab Attention) → STORY (Build Connection) → OFFER (Close the Deal)
```

**Scoring Dimensions (6 total):**

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Hook Strength | 2x | Does it stop the scroll and grab attention? |
| Story Connection | 1.5x | Does it create emotional connection and belief? |
| Offer Clarity | 2x | Is the offer clear, compelling, and irresistible? |
| Value Ladder Fit | 1x | Does this funnel fit the ascension path? |
| Traffic Match | 1.5x | Is the funnel matched to traffic temperature? |
| Conversion Path | 1x | Is the next step obvious and frictionless? |

**Max Score:** 100 points

## Rating Scale

| Score | Rating | Verdict |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 85-100 | Conversion Machine | Ready to scale. Minor optimizations only. |
| 70-84 | Strong Funnel | Good foundation. Fix weak points, then scale. |
| 55-69 | Leaky Funnel | Significant gaps. Fix before scaling traffic. |
| 40-54 | Broken Funnel | Major issues. Rebuild key components. |
| 0-39 | Non-Functional | Start over. Fundamental problems throughout. |

## Traffic Temperature Reference

| Temperature | They Know | Appropriate Funnel |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Cold | Nothing about you | Lead funnel, value-first content |
| Warm | Problem + your solution | Tripwire, webinar, challenge |
| Hot | Ready to buy | Sales page, order form, call booking |

## Value Ladder Reference

```
1. Free: Lead magnet, free content
2. Low-Ticket: $7-97 tripwire, self-liquidating offer
3. Mid-Ticket: $97-997 course, program
4. High-Ticket: $1K-10K coaching, done-for-you
5. Continuity: Recurring membership, retainer
```

## Integration

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `funnel-architect` | After validation, rebuild weak areas |
| `copy-validator` | Validate the copy on each page |
| `offer-validator` | Validate the core offer separately |
| `traffic-architect` | Design traffic strategy for validated funnel |
