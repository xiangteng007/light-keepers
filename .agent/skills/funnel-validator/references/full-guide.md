# Funnel Validator - Full Guide

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Gather the Funnel

Ask the user:

> **Show me your funnel. I need to see:**
>
> 1. What's the funnel URL or can you describe each step?
> 2. What's the entry point? (Ad, email, content, etc.)
> 3. What are you selling? (Free offer, low-ticket, high-ticket?)
> 4. What's the desired action? (Opt-in, purchase, call booking?)
> 5. Where is traffic coming from? (Paid ads, organic, email list?)
> 6. What's your current conversion rate? (If known)

**Funnel Types (Reference):**

- **Lead Funnel:** Free offer → Opt-in → Thank you + Upsell
- **Tripwire Funnel:** Low-ticket offer ($7-47) → Order form → OTO
- **Webinar Funnel:** Registration → Webinar → Application/Sale
- **Application Funnel:** Free content → Application → Call → Sale
- **Challenge Funnel:** Free challenge → Daily content → Pitch

### Step 2: Score Hook Strength (0-10, Weight: 2x)

Evaluate the **first 3 seconds** of the funnel experience:

- Does the **headline** stop the scroll?
- Is there a **pattern interrupt** (unexpected element)?
- Is the **hook specific** to the target audience?
- Does it create **curiosity** or **urgency**?
- Is the **promise** immediately clear?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Scroll-stopping hook, specific to audience, creates immediate curiosity |
| 7-8 | Strong hook, grabs attention, clear promise |
| 5-6 | Decent hook, somewhat generic, could be stronger |
| 3-4 | Weak hook, generic, doesn't stand out |
| 0-2 | No hook, boring headline, immediate bounce |

**Red Flags:**

- Generic headlines ("Welcome to our page")
- No headline above the fold
- Hook doesn't match the traffic source
- No curiosity or urgency element
- Wall of text before the hook

**Hook Formula:**

```
[End Result] + [Time Period] + [Address Objection]
"How to [Result] in [Time] Without [Objection]"
```

### Step 3: Score Story Connection (0-10, Weight: 1.5x)

Evaluate the **emotional journey**:

- Is there an **origin story** or **epiphany bridge**?
- Does the story create **relatability** ("I was like you")?
- Is there **conflict** and **transformation**?
- Does it build **belief** that the solution works?
- Is the story **relevant** to the audience's pain?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Powerful epiphany bridge, emotionally resonant, builds complete belief |
| 7-8 | Good story, relatable, some emotional connection |
| 5-6 | Story present but weak, or too long, or disconnected |
| 3-4 | Minimal story, facts without emotion |
| 0-2 | No story, just features and claims |

**Red Flags:**

- No story at all
- Story about the company, not the customer
- Story too long (loses attention)
- Story doesn't connect to the offer
- No transformation shown

**Epiphany Bridge Framework:**

```
1. Backstory (where you were)
2. Wall (the problem you hit)
3. Epiphany (the breakthrough discovery)
4. Plan (what you did about it)
5. Success (the result you achieved)
6. Transformation (who you became)
```

### Step 4: Score Offer Clarity (0-10, Weight: 2x)

Evaluate the **offer presentation**:

- Is the offer **immediately clear**?
- Is the **value proposition** compelling?
- Are the **deliverables** specific?
- Is there a **stack** (multiple components)?
- Is the **price** positioned correctly?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Crystal clear offer, overwhelming value stack, irresistible positioning |
| 7-8 | Clear offer, good value stack, compelling presentation |
| 5-6 | Offer understood but not compelling, weak stack or positioning |
| 3-4 | Confusing offer, unclear what they get |
| 0-2 | No clear offer, or buried below the fold |

**Red Flags:**

- Offer buried below the fold
- Confusing pricing or options
- No value stack
- Features without benefits
- Multiple CTAs competing

**Offer Clarity Test:**
Can someone explain what they get in one sentence?

### Step 5: Score Value Ladder Fit (0-10, Weight: 1x)

Evaluate **funnel positioning** in the ascension path:

- Does this funnel **match** the traffic temperature?
- Is there a logical **next step** after conversion?
- Does the offer **ascend** to higher-ticket?
- Is there a **tripwire** to create buyers?
- Is the **pricing** appropriate for this funnel stage?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Perfect ladder fit, clear ascension, obvious next step |
| 7-8 | Good ladder fit, ascension path exists |
| 5-6 | Decent fit, but gaps in the ladder |
| 3-4 | Funnel doesn't fit the ladder, pricing mismatch |
| 0-2 | No value ladder, dead-end funnel |

**Red Flags:**

- High-ticket offer to cold traffic
- No upsell or next step after purchase
- Pricing jump too large between steps
- Lead magnet unrelated to paid offer

### Step 6: Score Traffic Match (0-10, Weight: 1.5x)

Evaluate **traffic-to-funnel alignment**:

- Does the funnel match the **traffic temperature**?
- Is the **message-to-market match** strong?
- Does the landing page **continue the conversation** from the ad?
- Is the **ask appropriate** for the traffic type?
- Is there **congruence** from click to page?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Perfect match, message continues seamlessly, appropriate ask |
| 7-8 | Good match, minor disconnects, mostly congruent |
| 5-6 | Decent match, some friction, message shift |
| 3-4 | Poor match, confusing transition, wrong ask |
| 0-2 | Complete mismatch, traffic bouncing immediately |

**Red Flags:**

- Selling high-ticket to cold traffic
- Long-form sales page for hot traffic
- No scent trail from ad to page
- Headline doesn't match ad copy
- Asking for too much too soon

### Step 7: Score Conversion Path (0-10, Weight: 1x)

Evaluate the **path to conversion**:

- Is the **CTA** clear and prominent?
- Is there **one primary action** (not multiple)?
- Is the **form** simple (minimal fields)?
- Is there **friction** in the process?
- Is the **next step** obvious after conversion?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | One clear CTA, minimal friction, obvious next step |
| 7-8 | Clear CTA, some minor friction, good path |
| 5-6 | CTA present but not prominent, some friction |
| 3-4 | Multiple CTAs competing, confusing path |
| 0-2 | No clear CTA, or buried, major friction |

**Red Flags:**

- Multiple CTAs on the page
- Long forms with unnecessary fields
- No CTA above the fold
- Unclear what happens after clicking
- Exit popups before they've read anything

**CTA Best Practices:**

- One primary CTA per page
- Button text = outcome ("Get Instant Access")
- CTA above the fold AND at the end
- Minimize form fields (name + email max for opt-in)

### Step 8: Calculate Final Score

**Formula:**

```
Hook Strength × 2 = ___
Story Connection × 1.5 = ___
Offer Clarity × 2 = ___
Value Ladder Fit × 1 = ___
Traffic Match × 1.5 = ___
Conversion Path × 1 = ___
─────────────────────────
TOTAL = ___ / 100
```

### Step 9: Generate Recommendations

For each dimension scoring **below 7**, provide:

1. **What's wrong** (specific diagnosis)
2. **How to fix it** (actionable steps)
3. **Example** (show them what good looks like)

## Example Validations

### Example: Leaky Funnel

**User's Funnel:** Lead magnet opt-in page

**Issues Found:**

- Generic headline: "Download Our Free Guide"
- No story, just bullet points
- Form asks for phone number (unnecessary friction)
- No scent trail from Facebook ad

**Validation:**

| Dimension | Score | Issue |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook Strength | 4/10 | Generic, doesn't stop scroll |
| Story Connection | 2/10 | No story at all |
| Offer Clarity | 6/10 | Clear but not compelling |
| Value Ladder Fit | 7/10 | Good fit for lead gen |
| Traffic Match | 4/10 | Ad message doesn't continue |
| Conversion Path | 5/10 | Phone number field adding friction |

**Total: 46/100 - Broken Funnel**

**Priority Fixes:**

1. **Hook:** Rewrite to "How I Got 50 Clients in 30 Days Without Paid Ads"
2. **Story:** Add 2-3 sentence epiphany bridge about discovery
3. **Traffic Match:** Match headline to exact ad copy
4. **Conversion Path:** Remove phone number, keep name + email only

### Example: Strong Funnel

**User's Funnel:** Webinar registration

**Strengths:**

- Scroll-stopping hook with specific result
- Strong origin story video
- Clear value stack for attending
- Perfect traffic match from YouTube ads
- Single CTA, minimal form

**Validation:**

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook Strength | 9/10 | Specific, scroll-stopping, curiosity-driven |
| Story Connection | 8/10 | Good video story, could be tighter |
| Offer Clarity | 8/10 | Clear what they'll learn |
| Value Ladder Fit | 9/10 | Perfect for warm traffic |
| Traffic Match | 9/10 | YouTube ad → Webinar seamless |
| Conversion Path | 8/10 | Clean, but could add countdown |

**Total: 85/100 - Conversion Machine**

**Minor Optimizations:**

1. Add countdown timer to increase urgency
2. Tighten video story to under 2 minutes

## Common Validation Mistakes

1. **Ignoring Traffic Temperature:** The funnel might be great for the wrong traffic
2. **Missing the Hook:** First 3 seconds determine everything
3. **Forgetting Mobile:** Most traffic is mobile—test on phone
4. **Too Many CTAs:** One page, one goal
5. **No A/B Testing Reference:** Ask what they've already tested
6. **Ignoring the Ad:** The funnel starts with the traffic source
