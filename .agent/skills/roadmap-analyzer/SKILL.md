# Roadmap Analyzer

## Overview

This skill analyzes a project's current feature set against the needs of the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). Before analyzing, discover the project's ICP from documentation (`.agents/SYSTEM/` or project docs) and current features from the codebase and documentation.

The skill produces three outputs:

1. **Gap Analysis Table**: Side-by-side comparison of ICP needs vs current features with gaps highlighted
2. **Prioritized Backlog**: Ranked list of features to build next based on ICP alignment and impact
3. **Strategic Themes**: High-level focus areas with specific initiatives

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when asked to:

- "What should we build next?"
- "Compare our features against what our customers need"
- "Analyze product gaps for our ICP"
- "Help me plan the product roadmap"
- "What features are missing for our target customers?"
- "Evaluate our competitive positioning"
- "What do we need to focus on to serve SMBs creating UGC?"

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Current Features

Use a hybrid approach to identify existing project capabilities (discover from project):

#### 1.1 Automated Codebase Scan

Search the codebase for feature implementations. Focus on:

**Key directories to explore:**

```
apps/frontend-apps/*/      - Frontend applications
apps/apis/*/               - Backend APIs
packages/*/                - Shared packages
```

**Search patterns for features:**

- Component names (React components often indicate UI features)
- API endpoints (routes indicate backend capabilities)
- Service methods (business logic indicates functionality)
- Database schemas (data models reveal supported features)
- Configuration files (feature flags, settings)

**Use grep/glob to find:**

- Video editing features: `pattern: "edit|timeline|trim|cut|transition"`
- Avatar features: `pattern: "avatar|character|persona|voice"`
- Export features: `pattern: "export|format|platform|render"`
- Template features: `pattern: "template|preset|brand"`
- AI features: `pattern: "ai|generate|auto|openai|anthropic"`

#### 1.2 User Context Integration

Ask the user:

- "Are there features I should know about that might not be obvious in the code?"
- "Any recent features added that might not be fully integrated?"
- "Features in beta or soft-launched?"
- "Integrations or capabilities documented elsewhere?"

#### 1.3 Feature Inventory Creation

Organize discovered features into categories from `references/feature-categories.md`:

1. Content Input & Ideation
2. AI Avatar Creation & Management
3. Video Editing & Assembly
4. Visual Enhancement & Effects
5. Text, Captions & Typography
6. Audio & Music
7. Platform Optimization & Export
8. Templates & Brand Management
9. Collaboration & Workflow
10. Asset Management & Media Library
11. AI & Automation Features
12. Analytics & Performance
13. Learning & Support
14. Integration & Ecosystem
15. E-commerce & Monetization

For each feature, note:

- **Status**: Exists (production), Partial (incomplete), Planned, Missing
- **Quality**: Production-ready, Beta, Prototype, Needs improvement
- **Location**: Where found in codebase (file paths)

### Step 2: Load ICP and Editor Needs Context

Read the reference documents to understand requirements:

**Required reading:**

- `references/icp-profile.md` - Deep understanding of target customer needs
- `references/editor-needs.md` - What editors need for great social content
- `references/feature-categories.md` - Comprehensive feature taxonomy

**Key focus areas from ICP:**

1. **AI Avatar Army**: Creating multiple avatars, consistency, customization
2. **User Empowerment**: Self-service creation, templates, intuitive UX
3. **UGC at Scale**: Volume, speed, platform-native content
4. **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user, approvals, brand consistency

**Critical editor needs:**

- Platform-specific optimization (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)
- Fast pacing and trending effects
- Text overlays and captions
- Audio/music integration
- Quick variations for A/B testing

### Step 3: Gap Analysis

Compare current features against ICP needs and editor requirements.

#### 3.1 Create Gap Analysis Table

Format:

```markdown
| Feature Category | ICP Need Priority | Current State | Gap Severity | Key Missing Elements |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| AI Avatar Creation | CRITICAL | Partial | HIGH | Multiple avatars, avatar library, voice cloning |
| Platform Optimization | CRITICAL | Missing | CRITICAL | Auto-reframe, batch export multiple formats |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

**Gap Severity Levels:**

- **CRITICAL**: Blocking ICP adoption, core value prop missing
- **HIGH**: Significantly impacts ICP success, competitive disadvantage
- **MEDIUM**: Limits scale/efficiency, nice-to-have
- **LOW**: Future enhancement, not blocking

**Priority Levels:**

- **CRITICAL**: Must-have for ICP, core to value proposition
- **HIGH**: Important for ICP success, competitive requirement
- **MEDIUM**: Valuable but not essential
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have, future consideration

#### 3.2 Identify Critical Gaps

Highlight gaps where:

1. ICP Need Priority = CRITICAL AND Gap Severity = CRITICAL/HIGH
2. Feature is table stakes for competitors
3. Feature directly enables "AI avatar army" or "user empowerment"
4. Feature required for platform-native content (TikTok, Instagram, etc.)

### Step 4: Generate Prioritized Backlog

Create a ranked list of features to build next.

#### 4.1 Prioritization Framework

Score each feature on:

**ICP Impact (1-5)**

- 5: Core to ICP value prop, directly addresses primary pain point
- 4: Strongly supports ICP needs, key differentiator
- 3: Valuable for ICP, improves experience
- 2: Nice-to-have for ICP
- 1: Minimal ICP impact

**Urgency (1-5)**

- 5: Blocking sales/adoption, critical competitive gap
- 4: Significant competitive pressure, customer requests
- 3: On roadmap, good timing to build
- 2: Can wait, not time-sensitive
- 1: Future consideration

**Implementation Effort (1-5)**

- 5: Very high effort, 3+ months, complex
- 4: High effort, 1-3 months, significant work
- 3: Medium effort, 2-4 weeks, moderate complexity
- 2: Low effort, < 2 weeks, straightforward
- 1: Very low effort, < 1 week, simple

**Priority Score = (ICP Impact × 2 + Urgency × 1.5) / Implementation Effort**

Higher score = higher priority.

#### 4.2 Backlog Format

```markdown
## Prioritized Feature Backlog

### P0 (Build Immediately - Priority Score > 3.0)
1. **[Feature Name]** (Score: 4.2)
   - **Why**: [ICP impact explanation]
   - **Customer need**: [Specific ICP pain point addressed]
   - **Effort**: [Time estimate]
   - **Dependencies**: [What's needed first]

### P1 (Build Next Quarter - Priority Score 2.0-3.0)
[Same format]

### P2 (Future Consideration - Priority Score < 2.0)
[Same format]
```

#### 4.3 Quick Wins Section

Identify features with:

- High ICP Impact (4-5)
- Low Implementation Effort (1-2)
- Decent Urgency (3+)

These are "quick wins" that deliver high value with low investment.

### Step 5: Define Strategic Themes

Group features into high-level strategic focus areas.

#### 5.1 Theme Identification

Analyze feature clusters to identify 3-5 strategic themes, such as:

**Example themes:**

- **"AI Avatar Arsenal"**: Building the avatar creation and management system
- **"Platform-Native Mastery"**: Optimizing for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube
- **"Team Empowerment Engine"**: Collaboration, templates, workflows
- **"Speed to Market"**: Automation, batch processing, quick variations
- **"Editor's Toolkit"**: Core editing capabilities for creators

#### 5.2 Theme Structure

For each theme, provide:

```markdown
## [Theme Name]

**Vision**: [1-2 sentence vision for this theme]

**ICP Alignment**: [How this theme serves ICP needs]

**Current State**: [Where we are today]

**Target State**: [Where we need to be]

**Key Initiatives**:
1. **[Initiative Name]**
   - Features: [Specific features]
   - Impact: [Expected outcome]
   - Timeline: [When to build]

2. **[Next initiative]**
   [Same format]

**Success Metrics**:
- [Metric 1]: [Target]
- [Metric 2]: [Target]
```

#### 5.3 Theme Prioritization

Recommend theme focus order based on:

1. **Foundation themes first**: Core platform capabilities required for everything else
2. **Differentiator themes next**: Unique value props (e.g., AI avatar army)
3. **Enhancement themes last**: Improvements to existing capabilities

### Step 6: Output Assembly

Combine all analysis into a comprehensive report:

```markdown

## Executive Summary
[3-5 bullets summarizing key findings and recommendations]

## Gap Analysis
[Gap analysis table from Step 3]

## Critical Gaps

## Best Practices

### Analysis Quality

1. **Be specific**: Don't just say "add editing features"—specify "Add timeline trimming with frame-level precision"
2. **Show evidence**: Reference where features exist (or don't) in codebase
3. **Connect to customer**: Explain how each feature serves ICP needs
4. **Consider competition**: Note when gaps create competitive disadvantage
5. **Balance ambition with reality**: Acknowledge technical constraints

### Prioritization Rigor

1. **Defend scores**: Explain why a feature gets specific impact/urgency/effort scores
2. **Consider dependencies**: Note when features require others to be built first
3. **Think sequentially**: Some features enable others (e.g., avatar library before multi-avatar videos)
4. **Question assumptions**: If effort seems high, suggest simpler MVP versions

### Strategic Thinking

1. **Theme coherence**: Themes should feel cohesive, not arbitrary groupings
2. **ICP-centric**: Every recommendation should trace back to ICP needs
3. **Differentiation**: Emphasize features that set the project apart
4. **Reality check**: Acknowledge market timing, competitive landscape, technical feasibility

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't just list features**: Explain WHY each feature matters for ICP
2. **Don't ignore existing features**: Give credit for what already exists
3. **Don't treat all gaps equally**: Not all missing features are critical
4. **Don't forget the "AI avatar army" vision**: This is a key differentiator
5. **Don't overlook platform-specific needs**: TikTok ≠ YouTube
6. **Don't assume features work well**: Existing features might have quality gaps
