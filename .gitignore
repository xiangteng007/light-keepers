# ===========================================
# CI-Generated Dynamic Reports (DO NOT COMMIT)
# ===========================================
# These files contain timestamps and are regenerated each CI run.
# They should be uploaded as artifacts, not committed to repo.
# Committing them causes "evidence timestamp drift" audit issues.
#
# SSOT files that ARE committed:
#   - docs/policy/public-surface.policy.json (stable allowlist)
#   - docs/proof/security/public-surface.md (generated from policy)
#
# Dynamic reports that should NOT be committed:
docs/proof/gates/ci-gate-check-report.json
docs/proof/gates/ci-gate-check-report.md
docs/proof/gates/gate-summary.json
docs/proof/gates/gate-summary.md
docs/proof/logs/runtime-start.log
docs/proof/api/T7a-requests-responses.txt
