# Scale Validator - Full Guide

Complete guide to stress-testing business models using the Hormozi 10x framework.

## Step 1: Gather the Model

Ask the user:

> **Tell me about your business model:**
>
> 1. What do you sell? (Product/service/offer)
> 2. What's your current revenue and customer count?
> 3. How do you deliver what you sell? (Your time, team, software, products?)
> 4. What's your average sale price and profit margin?
> 5. How do you get customers? (Acquisition channels)
> 6. What takes most of your time right now?

## Scoring Criteria

### Time Independence (0-10, Weight: 2x)

Evaluate if the business can run **without the founder**:

- How many hours per week does the founder work **in** the business?
- Can **revenue be generated** while the founder is away?
- Are there **systems and processes** documented?
- Is there a **team** that can operate independently?
- What happens if the founder takes a **30-day vacation**?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Business runs 100% without founder, passive income achieved |
| 7-8 | Founder works ON business, not IN it, minimal daily involvement |
| 5-6 | Some delegation, but founder still critical for key operations |
| 3-4 | Founder is heavily involved, business struggles without them |
| 0-2 | Founder IS the business, no time freedom at all |

**Red Flags:**

- "I do all the sales calls"
- "Clients want to talk to me specifically"
- "I'm the only one who can [critical function]"
- No documented processes

**10x Question:**
> If you had 10x the customers, how many hours would you personally work?

### Unit Economics (0-10, Weight: 2x)

Evaluate if the **numbers work at scale**:

- What's the **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**?
- What's the **Lifetime Value (LTV)**?
- What's the **LTV:CAC ratio**? (Should be 3:1+)
- What's the **gross margin**?
- What's the **payback period** on customer acquisition?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | LTV:CAC 5:1+, 70%+ margins, sub-3-month payback |
| 7-8 | LTV:CAC 3:1-5:1, 50-70% margins, 3-6 month payback |
| 5-6 | LTV:CAC 2:1-3:1, 40-50% margins, 6-12 month payback |
| 3-4 | LTV:CAC 1:1-2:1, thin margins, long payback |
| 0-2 | Losing money on customers, unsustainable unit economics |

**Red Flags:**

- "I don't know my CAC"
- "I haven't calculated LTV"
- Margins below 30%
- Payback period over 12 months
- LTV:CAC below 2:1

**10x Question:**
> If you spent 10x on acquisition, would LTV:CAC ratio hold?

### Bottleneck Clarity (0-10, Weight: 1.5x)

Evaluate if they **know what's constraining growth**:

- Can they clearly **name the bottleneck**?
- Is the bottleneck **measurable**?
- Do they know the **order of bottlenecks** (first, second, third)?
- Have they **tested** removing the bottleneck?
- Is the bottleneck **internal** (they control) or **external**?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Crystal clear bottleneck identified, measured, with a plan to remove it |
| 7-8 | Bottleneck known, some data, working on solution |
| 5-6 | General idea of constraint, but not specific or measured |
| 3-4 | Vague sense of what's limiting, no data |
| 0-2 | No idea what's constraining growth |

**Red Flags:**

- "I need more of everything"
- "I just need more leads" (without data)
- Blaming external factors only
- No metrics to identify constraint

**Common Bottleneck Types:**

| Type | Signs | Solution |
|------|-------|----------|
| Lead Gen | Not enough qualified leads | Optimize acquisition |
| Sales | Leads not converting | Improve sales process |
| Delivery | Can't fulfill demand | Systematize/delegate |
| Cash | Can't afford to grow | Improve margins/capital |
| Time | Founder maxed out | Delegate/hire |

### Leverage Active (0-10, Weight: 1x)

Evaluate **how many leverage types** are being used:

**Four Types of Leverage:**

1. **Labor Leverage:** Using other people's time
2. **Capital Leverage:** Using other people's money
3. **Code/Media Leverage:** Using software/content
4. **Product Leverage:** Using standardized products

| Score | Leverage Active |
|-------|-----------------|
| 9-10 | 3-4 leverage types active and working |
| 7-8 | 2-3 leverage types active |
| 5-6 | 1-2 leverage types, room to expand |
| 3-4 | 1 leverage type (usually labor) |
| 0-2 | No leverage, founder does everything |

**Red Flags:**

- Pure service business with no systematization
- No team, no technology, no products
- Trading time for money only

**10x Question:**
> Which leverage type would you add to handle 10x volume?

### Delivery Scalability (0-10, Weight: 1.5x)

Evaluate if **delivery scales with demand**:

- Does 10x customers require 10x **labor**?
- Are there **economies of scale**?
- Is delivery **systematized and documented**?
- Can **technology** handle the load?
- Is **quality maintained** at scale?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Marginal cost near zero, infinite scale possible |
| 7-8 | 10x customers = 2-3x cost, strong economies of scale |
| 5-6 | 10x customers = 5-6x cost, some scalability |
| 3-4 | Linear scaling (10x = 10x cost) |
| 0-2 | Worse than linear, quality/cost degrades at scale |

**Red Flags:**

- "I deliver personally to every client"
- "We customize everything"
- No standard operating procedures
- Can't hire without losing quality

**Scale Questions:**

- What's the marginal cost per additional customer?
- What breaks first with 10x demand?
- How would you maintain quality at scale?

### Margin Integrity (0-10, Weight: 1x)

Evaluate if **margins hold at scale**:

- Do margins **improve** with scale (economies)?
- Do margins **compress** with scale (competition, complexity)?
- Are there **fixed costs** that scale benefits from?
- Is there **pricing power** or commoditization risk?
- What happens to margin at 10x revenue?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Margins improve at scale, strong pricing power |
| 7-8 | Margins hold steady, no degradation |
| 5-6 | Slight margin compression but sustainable |
| 3-4 | Significant margin compression at scale |
| 0-2 | Margins go negative at scale |

**Red Flags:**

- "We discount for volume"
- Commodity pricing pressure
- Increasing customer service costs at scale
- No fixed cost leverage

3. [ ] Systematize delivery
4. [ ] Scale acquisition

## Next Steps

### If Score 85+:
- [ ] Scale acquisition spend
- [ ] Monitor unit economics weekly
- [ ] Prepare for next bottleneck

### If Score 70-84:
- [ ] Fix weak dimensions above
- [ ] Re-validate after changes
- [ ] Test with 2x before 10x

### If Score 55-69:
- [ ] Do not scale yet
- [ ] Address bottlenecks first
- [ ] Use `business-model-auditor` for deeper analysis

### If Score Below 55:
- [ ] Stop acquisition spend
- [ ] Fix unit economics first
- [ ] Consider pivot or model change
