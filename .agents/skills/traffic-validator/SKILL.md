# Traffic Validator - Traffic Secrets Scorecard

Assess traffic strategy against Traffic Secrets principles. Expose scattered traffic efforts and unclear audience strategy.

**Brunson's Principle:** "Your customers are already congregating. Find the watering holes."

## When This Activates

- User asks "validate my traffic plan"
- User asks "is my audience strategy right"
- User says "I can't get enough traffic"
- User asks "should I do paid or organic"
- User mentions Dream 100

## The Framework

```
Dream 100 → Work In or Buy In → Hook → Funnel → Own the Audience
```

## Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Dream 100 Clarity | 2x | Do you know where audience congregates? |
| Hook Strategy | 1.5x | Are you interrupting the scroll? |
| Work In vs. Buy In | 1.5x | Is approach clear and appropriate? |
| Funnel Alignment | 1.5x | Does traffic match funnel temperature? |
| Audience Ownership | 1.5x | Are you building owned audience? |
| Conversion Path | 1x | Is traffic turning into customers? |

**Max Score:** 100 points

## Rating Scale

| Score | Rating | Verdict |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 85-100 | Traffic Machine | Scale and optimize |
