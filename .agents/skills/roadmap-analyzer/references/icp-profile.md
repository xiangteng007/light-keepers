# [Project] ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

**Note:** This is a template. Discover the project's actual ICP from project documentation (`.agents/SYSTEM/` or project docs).

## Primary Customer Segment: Marketing Agencies ⭐

**Why Agencies First:**

- **Volume producers** - Create the most content at scale
- **Recurring revenue** - Monthly/quarterly contracts
- **Team-focused** - Need empowerment features (approval workflows, multi-user)
- **Higher budgets** - $2,499-$4,999+ credit packs
- **Fast adoption** - Agencies evaluate tools quickly
- **Referral potential** - Agencies recommend tools to their clients

### Company Characteristics

- **Size**: Small to Medium Agencies (5-50 employees)
- **Industry Focus**:
  - **Digital marketing agencies** (PRIMARY TARGET ⭐)
  - Social media management agencies
  - Content creation agencies
  - Influencer marketing agencies
  - Video production agencies (transitioning to AI)
  - E-commerce agencies (managing client content)
- **Business Model**:
  - Retainer-based clients ($2K-$10K/month per client)
  - Need to scale content production efficiently
  - Multiple clients = multiple content streams
  - Team of 3-10 creators/account managers

### Key Pain Points (Agency-Specific)

1. **Content Volume at Scale** ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY

   - Need to produce 50-200+ pieces of content per month per client
   - Traditional video production too slow/expensive for volume
   - Can't scale without hiring expensive editors
   - Multiple clients = exponential content needs
   - **Impact**: Agencies need tools that handle volume efficiently

2. **Team Empowerment & Efficiency**

   - Account managers need to create content (not just strategists)
   - Current bottleneck: only 1-2 skilled creators can produce video
   - Need approval workflows for client review before publishing
   - Difficult to maintain brand consistency across multiple clients
   - **Impact**: Agencies need self-service tools with quality control

3. **Multi-Client Content Management**

   - Each client needs different brand voice/personality
   - Multiple avatar libraries per client (character consistency)
   - Client-specific templates and style guides
   - Need to manage content across multiple brands simultaneously
   - **Impact**: Agencies need brand/organization-scoped features

4. **Speed & Turnaround Time**

   - Clients expect rapid content delivery (same-day or next-day)
   - Trend-based content needs to be created in hours, not days
   - Campaign launches require fast content generation
   - A/B testing creative concepts quickly
   - **Impact**: Agencies need speed to win and retain clients

5. **Cost Efficiency & Margins**
   - High production costs eat into agency margins
   - Can't pass 100% of costs to clients (pricing pressure)
   - Need tools that improve margins while delivering quality
   - **Impact**: Agencies are price-sensitive but value ROI over sticker price
