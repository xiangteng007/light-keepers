# Copy Validator - Full Guide

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Gather the Copy

Ask the user:

> **Share your copy. I need to see:**
>
> 1. What type of copy is this? (Landing page, email, ad, sales letter?)
> 2. What's the goal? (Opt-in, sale, click, call booking?)
> 3. Who is this for? (Target audience)
> 4. What are you selling/offering?
> 5. Share the full copy (or link)

**If partial copy**, ask for the complete piece—context matters.

### Step 2: Score Hook Power (0-10, Weight: 2x)

Evaluate the **headline and opening lines**:

- Does the headline **stop the scroll**?
- Is there a **specific promise** or **curiosity hook**?
- Does it speak to a **specific audience**?
- Is there **tension** or **intrigue**?
- Does it **continue** from the traffic source?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Impossible to ignore, specific, creates immediate curiosity |
| 7-8 | Strong hook, grabs attention, clear promise |
| 5-6 | Decent hook, somewhat generic, could be stronger |
| 3-4 | Weak hook, generic, doesn't stand out |
| 0-2 | No hook, boring, or headline missing |

**Red Flags:**

- Generic headlines ("Welcome", "The Best [X]")
- No headline at all
- Headline doesn't match the body
- Too clever (cute kills conversions)
- No specific result or promise

**Hook Formulas That Work:**

```
1. How to [Desired Result] in [Time] Without [Pain Point]
2. The [Number] [Secrets/Mistakes] That [Result]
3. [Specific Result] in [Time] — Guaranteed
4. Warning: Don't [Action] Until You Read This
5. [Audience], Here's How to [Result] Even If [Objection]
```

### Step 3: Score Story Resonance (0-10, Weight: 1.5x)

Evaluate the **emotional journey**:

- Is there an **origin story** or **epiphany bridge**?
- Does it create **relatability** ("I was like you")?
- Is there **conflict** and **transformation**?
- Does it **transfer belief** that the solution works?
- Is the story **appropriate length** (not too long)?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Powerful story, emotionally resonant, perfect length, belief transferred |
| 7-8 | Good story, relatable, creates connection |
| 5-6 | Story present but weak or too long |
| 3-4 | Minimal story, factual without emotion |
| 0-2 | No story, just features and claims |

**Red Flags:**

- No story element at all
- Story about the company, not the customer journey
- Story too long (loses reader)
- Story doesn't connect to the offer
- Facts without feelings

**Story Elements Checklist:**

- [ ] Relatable starting point ("I was...")
- [ ] Conflict/struggle ("But then...")
- [ ] Discovery/epiphany ("That's when I realized...")
- [ ] Transformation ("Now I...")
- [ ] Bridge to reader ("And you can too...")

### Step 4: Score Proof Stacking (0-10, Weight: 1.5x)

Evaluate the **credibility elements**:

- Are there **testimonials** with specific results?
- Is there **social proof** (numbers, logos, media)?
- Are **claims backed** by evidence?
- Are **credentials** established?
- Is the proof **believable** (not inflated)?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Overwhelming proof, specific results, multiple types of evidence |
| 7-8 | Good proof, believable testimonials, some data |
| 5-6 | Some proof, but generic or weak |
| 3-4 | Minimal proof, or proof feels manufactured |
| 0-2 | No proof, or claims that seem too good to be true |

**Red Flags:**

- No testimonials or case studies
- Testimonials without specific results ("Great product!")
- Claims without backing ("The best in the industry")
- Inflated numbers that damage credibility
- Stock photos for testimonials

**Proof Types to Check:**

- **Testimonials:** Specific results, full names, photos
- **Case Studies:** Before/after, specific metrics
- **Data:** Numbers, percentages, timeframes
- **Authority:** Credentials, media mentions, logos
- **Social:** Customer count, subscribers, usage

### Step 5: Score Offer Presentation (0-10, Weight: 2x)

Evaluate how the **offer is presented**:

- Is the offer **immediately clear**?
- Is there a **value stack** showing components?
- Are **benefits** emphasized over features?
- Is the **price** positioned well (value vs. cost)?
- Does it feel like a **deal** they'd be stupid to refuse?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Crystal clear, value stack overwhelms, price feels like a steal |
| 7-8 | Clear offer, good value positioning, compelling |
| 5-6 | Offer understood but not exciting |
| 3-4 | Confusing offer, or weak value perception |
| 0-2 | No clear offer, or buried in copy |

**Red Flags:**

- Features without benefits
- Price mentioned without value context
- No value stack
- Multiple offers competing
- Offer buried at the bottom

**Value Presentation Formula:**

```
Total Value: $X,XXX
Today's Price: $XXX
You Save: $X,XXX
```

### Step 6: Score Urgency/Scarcity (0-10, Weight: 1x)

Evaluate the **reason to act now**:

- Is there **legitimate scarcity**?
- Is there **authentic urgency**?
- Is the deadline **believable**?
- What do they **lose by waiting**?
- Is it ethical (not fake)?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Legitimate scarcity/urgency, clear consequence for waiting |
| 7-8 | Good urgency, believable deadline or limit |
| 5-6 | Some urgency, but weak or vague |
| 3-4 | Fake-feeling urgency, or cliche ("Act now!") |
| 0-2 | No urgency, or obviously fake scarcity |

**Red Flags:**

- Evergreen countdown timers (fake)
- "Only 3 left!" on digital products
- No reason given for deadline
- Generic "Act now!" without specifics
- Urgency that contradicts other elements

**Legitimate Urgency Types:**

- **Capacity:** "Only 10 spots—I work with clients personally"
- **Cohort:** "Next group starts [date]"
- **Price:** "Price increases [date] to $X"
- **Bonus:** "Bonuses removed after [date]"
- **Seasonal:** "Before [event/season]"

### Step 7: Score CTA Strength (0-10, Weight: 1x)

Evaluate the **call-to-action**:

- Is there **one clear CTA** (not multiple)?
- Does the CTA **describe the outcome** (not the action)?
- Is it **above the fold** AND at the end?
- Is the button **visible** and **clickable-looking**?
- Is there **risk reversal** near the CTA?

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | One clear, outcome-focused CTA, prominent, with risk reversal |
| 7-8 | Clear CTA, good placement, compelling text |
| 5-6 | CTA present but weak text or placement |
| 3-4 | Multiple CTAs or generic ("Submit", "Click here") |
| 0-2 | No CTA, or buried/invisible |

**Red Flags:**

- "Submit" or "Click Here" (generic)
- Multiple competing CTAs
- CTA only at the bottom
- No risk reversal near CTA
- CTA that doesn't match the offer

**Strong CTA Formulas:**

```
[Get/Start/Claim] + [Outcome] + [Now/Today/Instantly]

Examples:
- "Get Instant Access Now"
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Claim My Spot"
- "Yes! Send Me The [Thing]"
```

### Step 8: Calculate Final Score

**Formula:**

```
Hook Power × 2 = ___
Story Resonance × 1.5 = ___
Proof Stacking × 1.5 = ___
Offer Presentation × 2 = ___
Urgency/Scarcity × 1 = ___
CTA Strength × 1 = ___
─────────────────────────
TOTAL = ___ / 100
```

### Step 9: Generate Rewrites

For each dimension scoring **below 7**, provide:

1. **What's wrong** (specific diagnosis)
2. **Why it hurts** (impact on conversion)
3. **Rewrite** (show them exactly what to change)

## Example Validations

### Example: Weak Landing Page Copy

**User's Headline:**
"Welcome to Our Marketing Agency"

**Body (summary):**

- List of services
- "We're the best in the industry"
- "Contact us today"
- No testimonials
- No story

**Validation:**

| Dimension | Score | Issue |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook Power | 2/10 | Generic, zero curiosity |
| Story Resonance | 1/10 | No story at all |
| Proof Stacking | 1/10 | "Best in industry" - no proof |
| Offer Presentation | 3/10 | Services listed, no value framing |
| Urgency/Scarcity | 0/10 | None |
| CTA Strength | 3/10 | "Contact us" - generic |

**Total: 18/100 - Broken Copy**

**Rewrites:**

**Headline:**
> Before: "Welcome to Our Marketing Agency"
> After: "We've Generated $47M in Revenue for 127 Clients — Here's How We Can Do the Same for You"

**CTA:**
> Before: "Contact Us"
> After: "Get Your Free Revenue Audit (Worth $997)"

### Example: Strong Email Copy

**User's Email:**

- Subject: "The $100K mistake I almost made (and how to avoid it)"
- Opens with relatable story
- Shares specific lesson learned
- Transitions to offer with clear value
- Deadline for bonus

**Validation:**

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook Power | 9/10 | Curiosity + specific number + warning |
| Story Resonance | 8/10 | Relatable, good epiphany bridge |
| Proof Stacking | 6/10 | Story is proof, but could add more |
| Offer Presentation | 8/10 | Clear, good transition from story |
| Urgency/Scarcity | 7/10 | Bonus deadline, could be stronger |
| CTA Strength | 8/10 | Clear, action-oriented |

**Total: 79/100 - Strong Copy**

**Minor Tweaks:**

1. Add a specific testimonial before CTA
2. Make deadline more specific (not just "this week")

## Common Validation Mistakes

1. **Ignoring Context:** Copy quality depends on audience and traffic source
2. **Rewriting Everything:** Focus on highest-impact changes first
3. **Being Too Nice:** Weak copy kills conversions—be direct
4. **Ignoring Mobile:** Most reading happens on phone
5. **No Examples:** Always provide specific rewrites, not just advice
6. **Forgetting Voice:** Rewrites should match brand voice
