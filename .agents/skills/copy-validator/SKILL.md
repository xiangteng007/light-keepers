# Copy Validator - Hook-Story-Offer Scorecard

## Overview

Ruthlessly assess sales copy against Russell Brunson's Hook-Story-Offer framework combined with classic direct response principles. Score objectively, expose weak points, provide rewrites.

**Brunson's Core Principle:** "The hook grabs them, the story connects them, the offer converts them."

## When This Activates

- "validate my copy"
- "rate my copy" / "rate my headline"
- "is my copy good"
- "why isn't my copy converting"
- Checking copy before publishing
- Landing page, email, or ad copy feedback

## The Framework: Hook-Story-Offer Scorecard

```
HOOK (Stop + Engage) → STORY (Connect + Believe) → OFFER (Desire + Act)
```

**Scoring Dimensions (6 total):**

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Hook Power | 2x | Does the headline stop and engage? |
| Story Resonance | 1.5x | Does the story create emotional connection? |
| Proof Stacking | 1.5x | Is there enough evidence to believe? |
| Offer Presentation | 2x | Is the offer clear and desirable? |
| Urgency/Scarcity | 1x | Is there a reason to act NOW? |
| CTA Strength | 1x | Is the call-to-action compelling and clear? |

**Max Score:** 100 points

## Quick Workflow

1. **Gather copy** - Type, goal, audience, full text
2. **Score Hook** (0-10) - Stops scroll? Specific promise? Tension?
3. **Score Story** (0-10) - Origin story? Relatability? Transformation?
4. **Score Proof** (0-10) - Testimonials? Social proof? Believable?
5. **Score Offer** (0-10) - Clear? Value stack? Benefits over features?
6. **Score Urgency** (0-10) - Legitimate scarcity? Clear deadline?
7. **Score CTA** (0-10) - One clear CTA? Outcome-focused? Risk reversal?
8. **Calculate total** - Apply weights, generate rating

## Rating Scale

| Score | Rating | Verdict |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 85-100 | Conversion Copy | Ready to run. Minor polish only. |
| 70-84 | Strong Copy | Good foundation. Fix weak points. |
| 55-69 | Leaky Copy | Significant gaps. Improve before running. |
| 40-54 | Weak Copy | Major issues. Rewrite key sections. |
| 0-39 | Broken Copy | Start over. Fundamental problems. |

## For Dimensions Below 7, Provide

1. **What's wrong** (specific diagnosis)
2. **Why it hurts** (impact on conversion)
3. **Rewrite** (show exactly what to change)

## Integration

| Skill | When to Use |
