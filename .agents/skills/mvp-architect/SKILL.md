# MVP Architect - Minimum Viable Product Scoping

## Overview

Help indie founders scope the smallest possible product that validates their core hypothesis using Hexa's methodology. Get to market in 3 months or less.

**Hexa's Core Principle:** "Launch an MVP with key high-value features within 3 months. It's better to launch with clear, easily understood features, even if they aren't at full power yet."

## When This Activates

- "What should my MVP include"
- "Help me scope my MVP"
- "What features do I need"
- "What to build first"
- "Been building for months, haven't launched"

## Hexa's 7 Principles

1. **Dig Beyond User Requests** — Root needs, not surface wants
2. **Combat Confirmation Bias** — Challenge assumptions
3. **Partner with Design Partners Early** — Build with real users
4. **Prioritize Adaptable Milestones** — 6-month goals, 2-week sprints
5. **Sketch Before Designing** — Keep ugly until validated
6. **Build Around Dry Elements** — Only include stable features
7. **Stress-Test Architecture** — Database design affects everything

## Quick Workflow

### Step 1: Problem Clarity Check

- 10+ customer interviews?
- One-sentence problem?
- 3-5 design partners?

### Step 2: Core Hypothesis

```
We believe that [customer] has a problem with [pain point].
We believe that [solution] will solve this.
We will know we're right when [success metric].
```

### Step 3: Feature Prioritization

For each feature ask:

- Tests core hypothesis? → Keep
- Users explicitly asked? → Maybe
- Critical path? → Keep
- Can do manually? → Don't build

**Target: 3-5 features maximum.**

### Step 4: Dry Elements Test

Only build features that remained stable through ALL design partner feedback.

### Step 5: User Journey (3-4 Screens)

- How do users sign up?
- First action?
- Core value delivery?
- Success confirmation?

## Anti-Scope Creep Checklist

Before adding ANY feature:

1. Does this test our core hypothesis? → If no, cut it
2. Have 3+ design partners asked? → If no, defer it
3. Can we launch without this? → If yes, defer it
4. Can we do this manually first? → If yes, don't build it
5. Will this delay launch by >3 days? → If yes, cut it

## The "Launch in 2 Weeks" Test

If you HAD to launch in 2 weeks, what would you cut?
**Whatever you'd cut... cut it now.** That's your real MVP.

## Integration

- `idea-validator` - Validate before scoping
- `startup-icp-definer` - Define who you're building for
- `fullstack-workspace-init` - Set up codebase
- `brand-architect` - Name and position product
