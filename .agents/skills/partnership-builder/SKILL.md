# Partnership Builder - Revenue Through Partnerships

Create revenue-generating partnerships for indie businesses: affiliate programs, integration partnerships, reseller networks, and co-marketing relationships.

**Core Principle:** "Partnerships multiply reach without multiplying effort. One good partner can be worth 1,000 cold emails."

## When This Activates
