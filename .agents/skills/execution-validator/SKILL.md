# Execution Validator - Hormozi Speed Scorecard

## Overview

Assess whether someone is ready to take action, if their scope is appropriate, and if they're building excuses or building businesses.

**Hormozi's Core Principle:** "Speed is the only competitive advantage that matters early on."

## When This Activates

- "validate my plan" / "am I ready to launch"
- "is my scope too big"
- "should I do X or Y first"
- "I'm still planning" / "I'm not ready yet"
- Been "working on something" for months
- Stuck in analysis paralysis

## The Framework: Speed Scorecard

**Core Questions:**

1. What's the fastest path to first customer?
2. What can you cut and still test the core assumption?
3. What are you waiting for that doesn't matter?

**Scoring Dimensions (5 total):**

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Action Bias | 2x | Taking action or planning? |
| Scope Minimalism | 2x | Tight or bloated scope? |
| Decision Clarity | 1.5x | Decisions made or pending? |
| Time to First Value | 2x | How fast to first customer? |
| Excuse Detection | 1.5x | Real blockers or fear? |

**Max Score:** 100 points

## Rating Scale

| Score | Rating | Verdict |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 85-100 | Ready to Execute | Stop planning. Execute now. |
| 70-84 | Almost Ready | Minor adjustments, then go. |
| 55-69 | Needs Work | Cut scope, make decisions, move faster. |
| 40-54 | Stuck | Major mindset/scope issues. |
| 0-39 | Analysis Paralysis | One week sprint to launch. |

## Hormozi Gut Checks

> If you had a gun to your head and had to make money from this in 7 days, what would you do?
>
> If you could only build ONE thing and charge for it tomorrow, what would it be?
>
> If someone offered you $1M to launch in 7 days, could you do it? If yes, your "blockers" are excuses.

## Common Excuses Disguised as Blockers

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I need to learn more" | You learn by doing |
| "The market isn't ready" | You haven't tested |
| "I need more funding" | Start smaller |
| "I need a co-founder" | Start solo first |
| "I need to finish [feature]" | Launch without it |
| "Perfect timing" | There is no perfect timing |

## Integration

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `mvp-architect` | Scope the minimum viable product |
| `offer-validator` | Validate the offer before launch |
| `scale-validator` | After launch, assess scalability |
