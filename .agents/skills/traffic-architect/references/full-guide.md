# Traffic Architect - Full Guide

Complete guide to designing traffic strategies using Traffic Secrets principles.

## Step 1: Discovery

Ask the user:

> **Tell me about your audience:**
>
> 1. Who is your ideal customer? (Be specific)
> 2. What problem do they have?
> 3. Where do they currently spend time online?
> 4. What influencers do they follow?
> 5. What communities are they in?
> 6. What are you selling? (Price point matters)

## Step 2: Build Dream 100

**Discovery Process:**

1. **Ask Your Customers:**
   - "Who do you follow for [topic]?"
   - "What podcasts do you listen to?"
   - "What groups are you in?"

2. **Research:**
   - Search "[niche] + podcast/youtube/newsletter"
   - Check social follows of existing customers
   - Look for guest appearances patterns

3. **Prioritize:**
   - Audience size
   - Audience overlap with your avatar
   - Accessibility (can you reach them?)
   - Content compatibility

**Dream 100 Template:**

| Name | Platform | Audience Size | Contact | Priority |
|------|----------|--------------|---------|----------|
| [Name] | [Platform] | [Size] | [Link] | [A/B/C] |

## Step 3: Work In vs. Buy In

**Work In (Organic):**

- Time investment, not money
- Build relationships
- Create content
- Slower but more sustainable

**Work In Tactics:**

- Guest on podcasts
- Collaborate with influencers
- Contribute to communities
- Create valuable content
- Comment and engage

**Buy In (Paid):**

- Money investment
- Sponsor content
- Run ads
- Faster results

**Buy In Tactics:**

- Sponsor newsletters
- Sponsor podcasts
- Run platform ads (Meta, Google, YouTube)
- Pay for shoutouts
- Advertise on Dream 100 channels

## Step 4: Design Hook Strategy

**Hook Types:**

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Result** | "How I [result] in [time]" | "How I got 50 clients in 30 days" |
| **Curiosity** | "The [thing] about [topic]" | "The truth about paid ads" |
| **Controversy** | "Why [common belief] is wrong" | "Why email marketing is dead" |
| **Story** | "The day [event happened]" | "The day I got fired changed everything" |
| **List** | "[Number] ways to [result]" | "7 ways to double your leads" |

**Platform-Specific Hooks:**

| Platform | Hook Style |
|----------|------------|
| Twitter/X | Short, punchy, controversial |
| LinkedIn | Professional, story-driven |
| YouTube | Curiosity + benefit |
| Instagram | Visual + short text |
| Podcast | Story/anecdote hook |
| Email | Personal, direct |

## Step 5: Map Traffic Temperature

**Cold Traffic (Don't know you):**

| Strategy | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Value-first content | How-to videos, guides |
| Lead magnet | Free resource, checklist |
| No selling | Educate and build trust |
| Long nurture | Multiple touchpoints |

**Warm Traffic (Know you, aware of problem):**

| Strategy | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Low-ticket offers | Tripwires, workshops |
| Webinars | Educational + pitch |
| Case studies | Show proof |
| Medium nurture | Shorter sequence |

**Hot Traffic (Ready to buy):**

| Strategy | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Direct offers | Sales pages |
| Booking pages | Call scheduling |
| Special offers | Limited time deals |
| Short/no nurture | Direct conversion |

## Step 6: Plan Audience Ownership

**Priority 1: Email List**

- Lead magnet → Email capture
- Content upgrades
- Exit intent popups
- Gated content

**Priority 2: SMS (if applicable)**

- High engagement
- Time-sensitive offers
- Local businesses

**Priority 3: Community**

- Slack, Discord, Circle
- Higher engagement
- Relationship building

**Lead Magnet Ideas:**

| Type | Examples | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Checklist | "10-point checklist for X" | Quick wins |
| Template | "My exact [thing] template" | Practical value |
| Guide | "Complete guide to X" | Comprehensive topics |
| Video training | "Free 30-min training" | Complex topics |
| Quiz | "Find your [type]" | Engagement |
| Tool | "Free calculator/tool" | Practical value |
