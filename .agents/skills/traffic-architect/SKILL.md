# Traffic Architect - Traffic Secrets Builder

Design traffic strategies using Traffic Secrets principles: Dream 100, Work In vs. Buy In, traffic temperature, and audience ownership.

**Brunson's Core Principle:** "Your customers are already congregating. Find the watering holes."

## When This Activates

- User asks "build my traffic plan"
- User asks "create my Dream 100"
- User asks "plan my audience strategy"
- User says "I need more traffic"
- User mentions traffic, leads, or audience building

## The Framework: Traffic Secrets

**Core Components:**

1. **Dream 100** - Where your audience congregates
2. **Work In vs. Buy In** - Organic or paid approach
3. **Hook Strategy** - Interrupting the scroll
4. **Own the Audience** - Building email list
