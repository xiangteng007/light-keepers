# Task & PRD Creator - Full Guide

## The Workflow: Create Task + PRD

### Step 1: Understand Request (Detect Complexity)

1. Analyze the request to determine complexity:
   - **Simple task:** One-shot, straightforward implementation (< 1 hour, few files)
   - **Complex feature:** Multi-step, requires planning (> 1 hour, multiple files/systems)

2. Ask clarifying questions:
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who are the users?
   - What's the expected behavior?
   - Any constraints or requirements?

### Step 2: Gather Requirements

Ask these questions if not clear from request:

- Which app/project is this for?
- What's the priority? (CRITICAL, High, Medium, Low, Future)
- What's the main goal/outcome?
- Are there dependencies on other tasks?
- Any specific technical requirements?

### Step 3: Check Existing System

1. Read relevant architecture docs:

   ```bash
   # For API features
   cat [api-project]/.agents/SYSTEM/ARCHITECTURE.md
   cat [api-project]/.agents/SYSTEM/RULES.md

   # For Frontend features
   cat [frontend-project]/.agents/SYSTEM/ARCHITECTURE.md
   ```

2. Search for similar implementations:

   ```bash
   grep -r "similar_pattern" [project]/
   ```

3. Check examples:

   ```bash
   cat .agents/EXAMPLES/[category]/[example-name].md
   ```

### Step 4: Fetch Latest Library Docs (MANDATORY)

Use Context7 MCP for all relevant libraries:

```typescript
// Example for Next.js feature
await mcp_context7_resolve_library_id("nextjs");
await mcp_context7_get_library_docs(
  "/vercel/next.js",
  "app router server actions"
);

// Example for NestJS feature
await mcp_context7_resolve_library_id("nestjs");
await mcp_context7_get_library_docs(
  "/nestjs/docs.nestjs.com",
  "guards decorators"
);
```

### Step 5: Create Files (Task + PRD)

#### 5.1 Determine File Locations

**Task file locations:**

- **Frontend tasks:**
  - Task: `[frontend-project]/.agents/TASKS/[task-name].md`
  - PRD: `[frontend-project]/.agents/PRDS/[subfolder]/[task-name].md`

- **Backend tasks:**
  - Task: `[backend-project]/.agents/TASKS/[task-name].md`
  - PRD: `[backend-project]/.agents/PRDS/[task-name].md`

- **Cross-project tasks:**
  - Task: `.agents/TASKS/[task-name].md` (workspace root)
  - PRD: `.agents/PRDS/[task-name].md`

#### 5.2 Choose Template Type

- **User Story** - Feature from user perspective
- **Technical Task** - Implementation-focused
- **Bug Fix** - Fix existing issue
- **Enhancement** - Improve existing feature
- **Migration** - Move/refactor existing code
- **Research** - Investigation/audit task

### Step 6: Present to User & Get Approval

1. Present to user:
   - Show both file locations (task + PRD)
   - Summary of the task breakdown
   - Explain approach and scope
   - List what will be created/modified
   - Mention any risks or concerns

2. Ask if they want to proceed with implementation or adjust the task

3. **WAIT for user approval before coding**

## Templates

### Task Template: Structured Format

**CRITICAL:** All tasks MUST follow this exact structured format for Kanban Markdown extension compatibility.

```markdown
## Task: [Feature Name]

**ID:** feature-name-slug
**Label:** [App]: [Feature Name]
**Description:** [Brief description of what this task accomplishes]
**Type:** Feature
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** High
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**PRD:** [Link](../PRDS/[path]/feature-name.md)

---
```

**Metadata Fields:**

- `ID`: kebab-case-slug (filename without .md)
- `Label`: Human-readable title with app prefix
- `Description`: Brief description of what this task accomplishes
- `Type`: Feature | Bug | Enhancement | Task | Migration | Audit | Planning
- `Status`: Backlog | To Do | Testing | Done
- `Priority`: High | Medium | Low
- `Created`: YYYY-MM-DD (when task was first created)
- `Updated`: YYYY-MM-DD (when task was last modified)
- `PRD`: Link to PRD file (relative path)

**Status Rules:**

- Not started: `Status: Backlog`
- In progress: `Status: To Do`
- Testing: `Status: Testing`
- Complete: `Status: Done`

### PRD Template

**File naming:** Same as task file: `[task-name].md`
**Location:** `<project>/.agents/PRDS/[subdirs]/[task-name].md`

**CRITICAL:** PRDs MUST NOT contain checkboxes (`- [ ]` or `- [x]`). Use plain bullets `-` instead.

```markdown
# [App]: [Feature Name]

**Priority:** High | Medium | Low
**Status:** Not Started | In Progress | Done
**Type:** Feature | Bug | Enhancement | Task | Migration | Audit
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Implementation Notes:**

[Any additional notes, gotchas, or things to watch out for during implementation]

```

## Naming Conventions

**File naming:** `kebab-case-task-name.md`

**Good names:**
- `video-generation-with-captions.md`
- `quick-actions-audit.md`
- `multi-platform-integration.md`
- `organization-review.md`

**Bad names:**
- `feature.md` (too generic)
- `VideoGeneration.md` (wrong case)
- `video_generation.md` (use kebab, not snake)
- `video-gen.md` (don't abbreviate)

## Update Task Status

When user says:
- "Mark [task] as complete"
- "Update status of [task] to in progress"
- "Change priority of [task] to high"

**Your Actions:**

1. Find the task file
2. Read current status/priority
3. Update the relevant fields:
   - `**Status:**` → new status
   - `**Updated:**` → current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `**Priority:**` (if changing)
4. If marking complete, also update linked PRD status
5. Confirm with user

**Status Values:**
- Backlog → To Do → Testing → Done
- Also: Blocked, Cancelled

## Example Interaction

**User:** "I want to add video generation with captions to Studio"

**Your Response:**

```

Great! Let me create a proper task and PRD for this.

A few quick questions:

1. Priority: Is this critical for this week, or can it wait?
2. Should captions be embedded in video or overlaid?
3. Any specific caption styling requirements?

[After getting answers]

[You check architecture, fetch Context7 docs for ffmpeg, Next.js, etc.]

I've created the task files:
📄 [project]/.agents/TASKS/video-generation-with-captions.md
📄 [project]/.agents/PRDS/video-generation-with-captions.md

This task includes:

- Integration with caption API
- Caption positioning options
- Styling controls
- Preview with captions
- Multi-language support

The PRD includes detailed implementation steps, files to create/modify, and testing requirements.

Review the files and let me know if you'd like to proceed with implementation or make changes!
