name: project-scaffold
description: Unified project scaffolder that works across all platforms. Scaffold .agent folders, backend (NestJS), frontend (NextJS), mobile (Expo), and browser extensions (Plasmo) with interactive prompts. Supports both monorepo and separate repository structures, and can add components to existing projects.

# Project Scaffold

Unified project scaffolder for creating new projects or adding components to existing ones.

## Purpose

This skill provides a unified way to scaffold:

- `.agents/` folder structure for AI-first development
- Backend (NestJS) with MongoDB, Swagger, and best practices
- Frontend (NextJS) with Tailwind and @agenticindiedev/ui
- Mobile (Expo) with React Native and Expo Router
- Browser Extension (Plasmo) with React and Tailwind

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Starting a new project from scratch
- Adding components to an existing project
- Setting up a monorepo or separate repositories
- Need a unified scaffolding experience across Claude, Codex, and Cursor

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/project-scaffold/scripts/scaffold.py
```

The script will ask you:

1. Project name
2. Project root path
3. Repository structure (monorepo vs separate)
4. Components to scaffold (all optional):
   - .agent folder
   - Backend (NestJS)
   - Frontend (NextJS)
   - Mobile (Expo)
   - Extension (Plasmo)
5. Organization name (for monorepo packages)

### From Claude

When user requests scaffolding, activate this skill and run:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/project-scaffold/scripts/scaffold.py
```

The script handles all interactive prompts.

## Features

### Flexible Structure

- **Monorepo**: All components in one repository with workspace configuration
- **Separate repos**: Each component in its own directory/repository
- **Existing projects**: Can add components to existing projects

### Component Options

All components are optional - scaffold only what you need:

- `.agents/` folder with full AI documentation structure
- Backend with NestJS, MongoDB, Swagger
- Frontend with NextJS 15, Tailwind, @agenticindiedev/ui
- Mobile with Expo Router, React Native
- Extension with Plasmo, React, Tailwind

### Cross-Platform

Works from:

- Claude Code
- Codex
- Cursor

## Generated Structure

### Monorepo Example

```
myproject/
├── .agents/                  # AI documentation
├── package.json             # Workspace root
├── api/                     # NestJS backend
│   ├── .agents/
│   ├── apps/api/src/
│   └── package.json
├── frontend/                # NextJS apps
│   ├── .agents/
│   ├── apps/dashboard/
│   └── package.json
├── mobile/                  # Expo app
│   ├── .agents/
│   ├── app/
│   └── package.json
└── extension/               # Plasmo extension
    ├── .agents/
    ├── src/
    └── package.json
```

### Separate Repos Example

```
myproject-api/               # Backend only
├── .agents/
├── apps/api/src/
└── package.json

myproject-frontend/          # Frontend only
├── .agents/
├── apps/dashboard/
└── package.json
```

## Key Patterns Included

### Backend (NestJS)

- Soft deletes: `isDeleted: boolean`
- Multi-tenancy: Always filter by `organization`
- Collection pattern: controllers → services → schemas
- Swagger documentation
- Dockerfile included

### Frontend (NextJS)

- Path aliases: `@components/`, `@services/`, `@hooks/`
- Tailwind CSS with @agenticindiedev/ui
- TypeScript strict mode
- App Router structure

### Mobile (Expo)

- Expo Router for navigation
- TypeScript configuration
- Platform-specific configurations

### Extension (Plasmo)

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with @agenticindiedev/ui
- Manifest configuration
- Popup component

## Next Steps After Scaffolding

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd [project-root]
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start development**:

   ```bash
   # Monorepo
   bun run dev:api
   bun run dev:frontend
   
   # Separate repos
   cd api && bun run start:dev
   cd frontend && bun run dev
   ```

3. **Customize**:
   - Update `.agents/SYSTEM/RULES.md` with your coding standards
   - Configure environment variables
   - Add your first features

## Integration with Existing Skills

This skill integrates with:

- `agent-folder-init`: Uses its script for .agent folder scaffolding
- `fullstack-workspace-init`: Reuses component templates and patterns

## Troubleshooting

**Script not found**: Ensure the skill is installed in `~/.claude/skills/project-scaffold/`

**Permission denied**: Make script executable: `chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/project-scaffold/scripts/scaffold.py`

**Python not found**: Ensure Python 3 is installed and in PATH

**Agent folder not created**: The script tries to use `agent-folder-init` skill. If not found, it will skip .agent folder creation.
