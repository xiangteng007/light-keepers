# Startup ICP Definer - Ideal Customer Profile Builder

## Overview

Help indie founders precisely define who they're building for using Hexa's Opportunity Memo methodology. Execute rigorous customer definition by guiding users through buying center mapping, pain point hierarchies, and validation frameworks.

**Hexa's Core Principle:** "Define the company type + the buying center people involved in the decision-making process."

## When This Activates

- "Who is my customer"
- "Define my ICP"
- Target audience questions
- Customer personas
- "Everyone could use this"
- "Who should I target first"

## The Framework: ICP Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         BUYING CENTER                    │
│    (All people in the decision)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         USER PERSONA                     │
│    (Who uses it daily)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         BUYER PERSONA                    │
│    (Who signs the check)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         COMPANY PROFILE                  │
│    (The organization)                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Build from bottom up: Company → Buyer → User → Buying Center.

## Quick Workflow

### Step 1: Company Profile

- Industry/vertical
- Company size (employees/revenue)
- Stage (startup, growth, enterprise)
- Geography
- Tech stack

### Step 2: Buyer Persona

- Title/role, seniority
- Goals and KPIs
- Decision authority
- What they care about (cost, time, risk)

### Step 3: User Persona

- Daily workflow
- Pain points
- Tech savviness

### Step 4: Buying Center Map

- Champion, Economic Buyer, Technical Evaluator
- End User, Influencer, Blocker

### Step 5: Pain Hierarchy

Score: Urgency + Cost + Frequency + Actively Solving
**Focus on pains scoring 8+**

## The 50-Company Test

Before finalizing ICP:

1. List 50 specific companies that fit
2. Find buyer's name at 20 of them
3. Reach out to 10

If you can't do this, your ICP isn't specific enough.

## Too Broad Warning Signs

- Can't name 50 specific companies
- Can't find 10 people to interview
- Messaging must be vague to apply
- Sales conversations feel scattered

## Integration

- `idea-validator` - Validate the problem
- `market-sizer` - Size the segment
- `leads-researcher` - Find matching companies
- `offer-architect` - Design offer for ICP
- `outbound-optimizer` - Write outreach
