Build from bottom up. Define the company first, then the buyer, then the user, then the full buying center.

## Detailed Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Company Profile Definition

Ask the user:

> **What type of company is your ideal customer?**
>
> 1. What industry or vertical?
> 2. What company size? (Employees or revenue)
> 3. What company stage? (Startup, growth, enterprise)
> 4. What geography?
> 5. What technology stack or tools do they use?
> 6. What business model? (B2B, B2C, marketplace)

**Company Profile Template:**

| Attribute | Definition | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Industry** | [Specific vertical] | [Why this industry] |
| **Size** | [X-Y employees OR $X-$Y revenue] | [Why this size] |
| **Stage** | [Startup/Growth/Enterprise] | [Why this stage] |
| **Geography** | [Regions/Countries] | [Why this geography] |
| **Tech Stack** | [Key tools they use] | [Why this matters] |
| **Business Model** | [B2B/B2C/etc.] | [Why this model] |

**Example:**

```
Industry: B2B SaaS companies
Size: 50-500 employees
Stage: Series A to Series C
Geography: US, UK, Western Europe
Tech Stack: Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack
Business Model: Recurring revenue software
```

### Step 2: Problem Segmentation

**Not all companies in your profile have the same pain intensity.**

Ask the user:

> **What triggers a company to seek your solution?**
>
> 1. What event creates urgency? (Growth, pain, mandate)
> 2. What symptoms indicate they need you?
> 3. What makes some companies better fits than others?
> 4. What situations make them NOT a fit?

**Trigger Events:**

| Trigger | What It Means | Urgency Level |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| [Trigger 1] | [Situation] | [High/Med/Low] |
| [Trigger 2] | [Situation] | [High/Med/Low] |
| [Trigger 3] | [Situation] | [High/Med/Low] |

**Common B2B Triggers:**

- Rapid headcount growth
- New executive hire
- Failed with competitor product
- Compliance/regulatory requirement
- Major customer demand
- Funding event (just raised)
- Manual process breaking down
- Integration with new tool

### Step 3: Buyer Persona Definition

**The buyer = the person who signs the check.**

Ask the user:

> **Who is the buyer in your ICP?**
>
> 1. What's their title/role?
> 2. What's their seniority level?
> 3. What are their goals and KPIs?
> 4. What are their frustrations?
> 5. What's their decision-making authority?
> 6. What do they care about most? (Cost, time, risk, outcomes)

**Buyer Persona Canvas:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BUYER PERSONA: [Title]                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Title: [Exact title]                            │
│ Reports to: [Boss's role]                       │
│ Team size: [X people]                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Goals:                                          │
│ • [Goal 1]                                      │
│ • [Goal 2]                                      │
│ • [Goal 3]                                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│ • [Frustration 2]                               │
│ • [Frustration 3]                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Success Metrics:                                │
│ • [KPI 1]                                       │
│ • [KPI 2]                                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Decision Authority: [Budget they can approve]   │
│ Decision Process: [How they buy]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 4: User Persona Definition

**The user = the person who uses it daily (may differ from buyer).**

Ask the user:

> **Who actually uses your product day-to-day?**
>
> 1. What's their title/role?
> 2. What's their daily workflow?
> 3. What tasks do they do that involve your product?
> 4. What frustrates them about current process?
> 5. What would make their day easier?
> 6. How tech-savvy are they?

**User Persona Canvas:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ USER PERSONA: [Title]                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Title: [Exact title]                            │
│ Reports to: [Usually the buyer]                 │
│ Daily tasks: [What they do]                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Current Process:                                │
│ • [Step 1 of how they do it today]              │
│ • [Step 2]                                      │
│ • [Step 3]                                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Pain Points:                                    │
│ • [Pain 1 - What's broken]                      │
│ • [Pain 2 - What's slow]                        │
│ • [Pain 3 - What's frustrating]                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Desired Outcome:                                │
│ [What would make their life better]             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tech Comfort: [Low/Medium/High]                 │
│ Adoption Pattern: [Early adopter/Mainstream]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 5: Buying Center Mapping

**In B2B, multiple people influence the decision.**

Ask the user:

> **Who else is involved in the buying decision?**
>
> 1. Who initiates the search for a solution?
> 2. Who evaluates options?
> 3. Who influences the decision?
> 4. Who can block or veto?
> 5. Who approves the budget?
> 6. Who implements/onboards?

**Buying Center Roles:**

| Role | Title | Power | How to Win Them |
|------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Champion** | [Title] | Drives internally | [Strategy] |
| **Economic Buyer** | [Title] | Approves budget | [Strategy] |
| **Technical Evaluator** | [Title] | Validates solution | [Strategy] |
| **End User** | [Title] | Uses daily | [Strategy] |
| **Influencer** | [Title] | Advises decision | [Strategy] |
| **Blocker** | [Title] | Can veto | [Strategy] |

**Buying Center Map:**

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │   CEO/CFO    │ ← Final approval
                    │ (Eco. Buyer) │   for large deals
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐
              │            │            │
       ┌──────┴──────┐  ┌──┴───┐  ┌────┴─────┐
       │  VP Sales   │  │  IT  │  │  Legal   │
       │ (Champion)  │  │(Tech │  │(Blocker) │
       └──────┬──────┘  │Eval) │  └──────────┘
              │         └──────┘
       ┌──────┴──────┐
       │  Sales Rep  │
       │ (End User)  │
       └─────────────┘
```

### Step 6: Pain Point Hierarchy

**Not all pains are created equal.**

Ask the user:

> **Rank your customer's pain points:**
>
> 1. What pain is most urgent?
> 2. What pain costs them the most money?
> 3. What pain is most frequent?
> 4. What pain are they actively trying to solve?

**Pain Hierarchy Framework:**

| Pain | Urgency | Cost | Frequency | Actively Solving? | Score |
|------|---------|------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| [Pain 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Y/N] | [Sum] |
| [Pain 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Y/N] | [Sum] |
| [Pain 3] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Y/N] | [Sum] |

**Scoring:** H=3, M=2, L=1, Y=+2, N=0
**Focus on pains scoring 8+ first.**

### Step 7: ICP Validation Interview Guide

**Validate your ICP with real conversations.**

Ask the user:

> **How will you validate this ICP?**
>
> 1. Do you have access to people matching this profile?
> 2. Have you talked to 10+ people in this segment?
> 3. What questions will you ask to validate?

**Interview Question Bank:**

| Category | Question | What You Learn |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Problem** | "Walk me through how you currently handle [X]" | Current process |
| **Pain** | "What's the most frustrating part of that?" | Pain intensity |
| **Impact** | "What does that cost you? (Time/money/stress)" | Pain magnitude |
| **Solutions** | "What have you tried to solve this?" | Competition |
| **Budget** | "Do you have budget allocated for this?" | Buying intent |
| **Timeline** | "When do you need to solve this by?" | Urgency |
| **Decision** | "How do you typically evaluate tools like this?" | Buying process |

### Step 8: ICP Narrowing Criteria

**Start narrow, expand later.**

Ask the user:

> **Which constraints help you focus?**
>
> 1. What makes a company a PERFECT fit?
> 2. What makes them a GOOD fit?
> 3. What makes them a BAD fit?
> 4. What's a disqualifier?

**Fit Scoring Framework:**

| Criterion | Perfect Fit | Good Fit | Bad Fit | Disqualifier |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Company Size | [Exact] | [Range] | [Outside] | [Never] |
| Industry | [Exact] | [Adjacent] | [Far] | [Never] |
| Tech Stack | [Uses X] | [Uses Y] | [No Y] | [Uses Z] |
| Budget | [Has budget] | [Can find] | [No budget] | [Never pay] |
| Pain | [Acute] | [Moderate] | [Mild] | [None] |
| Timeline | [Now] | [3 months] | [6 months] | [No timeline] |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too broad:** "All companies" is not an ICP
2. **Too narrow:** "Left-handed CEOs in Iowa" is too small
3. **Buyer/User confusion:** They're often different people
4. **Ignoring buying center:** Multiple people matter
5. **Assuming, not validating:** Talk to real customers
6. **Static ICP:** It should evolve with learnings
7. **Feature-led personas:** Define by problems, not features
8. **Skipping anti-personas:** Know who NOT to target
