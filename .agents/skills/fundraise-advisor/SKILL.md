# Fundraise Advisor - Seed Round Strategy

## Overview

Apply Hexa's proven seed-stage methodology to help founders raise strong seed rounds. Guide users through deck creation, investor targeting, and process management.

**Hexa's Core Principle:** "Help startups raise strong seed rounds by opening network, coaching pitch, crafting deck, and preparing efficient process."

## When This Activates

- "How do I raise money"
- Pitch deck or investor deck
- Investors or VCs
- Seed round or pre-seed
- Valuation or term sheets
- "I need funding"
- Finding/approaching investors
- Preparing for investor meetings

## Fundraising Funnel

```
Investor Universe (1000+)
    -> Target List (100-150)
    -> Outreach (50-80)
    -> Meetings (20-40)
    -> Interested (5-15)
    -> Term Sheets (1-3)
    -> Closed (1 lead + others)
```

## Readiness Checklist

| Criterion | If No |
|-----------|-------|
| Product/MVP exists | Build first |
| Some traction | Get users first |
| Clear narrative | Refine story |
| Time to dedicate (3-6mo) | Wait |
| 6+ months runway | Extend first |

**If 3+ "No":** Wait or bootstrap further.

## Typical Seed Ranges (2024-2025)

| Stage | Raise | Valuation | Dilution |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Pre-seed | $250K-$1M | $3M-$8M | 10-20% |
| Seed | $1M-$4M | $8M-$20M | 15-25% |

## Standard Deck (10-15 slides)

1. **Title** - Hook + one-liner
2. **Problem** - Specific pain, who has it
3. **Solution** - How you solve it
4. **Product** - Demo, screenshots
5. **Market** - TAM/SAM/SOM
6. **Business Model** - Unit economics
7. **Traction** - Metrics, growth
8. **Competition** - Why you win
9. **Team** - Why you'll execute
10. **Ask** - Amount, milestones

## Investor Categories

| Type | Check Size | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| Angels | $10K-$100K | Pre-seed |
| Syndicates | $100K-$500K | Pre-seed/Seed |
| Micro VCs | $250K-$1M | Seed |
| Seed VCs | $500K-$3M | Seed |

## Outreach Priority

1. Warm intro from portfolio founder (30-50%)
2. Warm intro from mutual connection (20-40%)
3. Cold email with strong hook (5-15%)
4. Cold LinkedIn (2-10%)

## Process Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1-2 | Build list, start outreach |
| 3-4 | First meetings, refine pitch |
| 5-6 | Second meetings, data room |
| 7-8 | Partner meetings, diligence |
| 9-10 | Term sheet negotiations |
| 11-12 | Close round |

## Common Mistakes

- Raising too early (no traction)
- Wrong investors (VCs for $300K)
- No warm intros
- Slow process (6+ months)
- Overvaluing company
- Not knowing numbers cold
