# Idea Validator - Full Guide

Complete guide to validating startup ideas using Hexa's Opportunity Memo framework and PCV methodology.

## Step 1: Project Canvas (Executive Summary)

Ask the user:

> **Describe your idea in one sentence:**
>
> 1. What problem are you solving?
> 2. Who has this problem?
> 3. What's your proposed solution?
> 4. Why you? (Why are you the right person to build this?)

**One-Liner Template:**
"For [target customer] who [pain point], [Product Name] provides [solution] that [key benefit], unlike [alternatives] which [limitation]."

## Step 2: Problem Space Deep Dive

Ask the user:

> **Tell me about the problem:**
>
> 1. What is the specific pain point(s) your ICP feels?
> 2. How do they currently solve this problem?
> 3. What's wrong with the current solutions?
> 4. How often do they experience this pain?
> 5. What does this problem cost them?

**Problem Assessment Matrix:**

| Dimension | Current State | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Frequency | [Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly] | [High/Med/Low] |
| Severity | [Critical/Important/Nice-to-have] | [High/Med/Low] |
| Awareness | [Actively seeking/Aware/Unaware] | [High/Med/Low] |
| Budget | [Has budget/Would find budget/No budget] | [High/Med/Low] |

**Problem Score:** Count "High" ratings. 3-4 = Strong problem. 1-2 = Weak problem. 0 = Not a real problem.

## Step 3: Context & Timing Analysis

Ask the user:

> **Why is NOW the right time for this solution?**
>
> 1. What has changed recently that makes this possible/necessary?
> 2. What barriers existed before that are now gone?
> 3. What trends support this idea?
> 4. Why hasn't this been solved before?
> 5. What happens if they DON'T solve this in the next 12 months?

**Timing Assessment:**

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Technology enablers | [What tech now exists?] |
| Market shifts | [What behavior has changed?] |
| Regulatory changes | [What's now allowed/required?] |
| Economic factors | [What budget/spending has shifted?] |
| Competitive vacuum | [Why hasn't this been built?] |

## Step 4: ICP Definition

**ICP Canvas:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Company: [Type, Size, Industry]                 │
│ Buyer: [Title, Role, Decision Authority]        │
│ User: [Title, Daily workflow]                   │
│ Trigger: [What event creates urgency]           │
│ Budget: [Who pays, typical spend range]         │
│ Buying Center: [Who else influences decision]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Step 5: Solution & Value Proposition

**Value Proposition Framework:**

| Element | Your Answer |
|---------|-------------|
| **For** | [ICP description] |
| **Who** | [Key pain point] |
| **Our product is** | [Category] |
| **That provides** | [Key benefit] |
| **Unlike** | [Primary alternative] |
| **We** | [Key differentiator] |

## Step 6: Competitive Landscape

**Competitive Analysis:**

| Competitor | Type | Strengths | Weaknesses | Your Advantage |
|------------|------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| [Name] | Direct | | | |
| [Name] | Indirect | | | |
| DIY/Manual | Alternative | | | |
| Status Quo | Inaction | | | |

## Step 7: Perceived Created Value (PCV) Scoring

### Phase 1: Interview 20 potential customers

- Ask open-ended questions about their problem
- Understand their current solutions
- Don't pitch your solution—listen

### Phase 2: Assess Current Solution

| Dimension | Definition | Rating |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Price** | Cost of current solution | [a] Not a problem / [b] A problem / [c] Serious problem |
| **Quality** | Relevance, reliability, service | [a/b/c] |
| **Performance** | Speed, output, efficiency | [a/b/c] |
| **Convenience** | Usability, accessibility, ease | [a/b/c] |

### Phase 3: Evaluate Your Solution

| Dimension | Your Improvement |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Price** | [a] No difference / [b] Some improvement / [c] Serious improvement |
| **Quality** | [a/b/c] |
| **Performance** | [a/b/c] |
| **Convenience** | [a/b/c] |

### Phase 4: Calculate PCV Score

Scoring: a=0 points, b=1 point, c=3 points

**Sum all 8 ratings (4 problem + 4 solution):**

| Score | Interpretation | Recommendation |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 0-3 | Weak opportunity | Don't pursue |
| 4-6 | Moderate opportunity | Needs work—pivot or refine |
| 7-9 | Strong opportunity | Worth pursuing with caution |
| 10-12 | Excellent opportunity | Green light—move fast |
| 13+ | Exceptional opportunity | Build NOW |

## Step 8: Design Partner Validation

**Design Partner Readiness:**

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 3-5 identified potential customers | [Yes/No] |
| They've agreed to test early versions | [Yes/No] |
| They'll commit to regular feedback calls | [Yes/No] |
| They'll pay something (even discounted) | [Yes/No] |
| They have the problem acutely | [Yes/No] |

**Score:** 4-5 = Ready to build. 2-3 = Need more validation. 0-1 = Not ready.

### **Total PCV Score: X/24**

## Validation Next Steps

### If Score < 7
- [ ] Interview 10 more potential customers
- [ ] Identify what you got wrong about the problem
- [ ] Consider pivoting

### If Score 7-12
- [ ] Double down on customer interviews
- [ ] Refine value proposition
- [ ] Find 3 design partners before building

### If Score 13+
- [ ] Lock in 3-5 design partners
- [ ] Use `market-sizer` to size the opportunity
- [ ] Start building within 2 weeks

## Final Recommendation

**Verdict:** [Don't pursue / Pivot / Proceed with caution / Full speed ahead]
**If proceeding, first priority:** [Single most important next action]
```

## The 20-Interview Rule

Before declaring an idea validated:

1. Talk to **20 potential customers** (not friends, not family)
2. Ask about **their problem** (not your solution)
3. Understand **how they solve it today**
4. Learn **what they'd pay** for a better solution
5. Get **3-5 to commit** as design partners

**If you can't find 20 people to interview, the market might not exist.**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confirmation bias:** Only talking to people who agree with you
2. **Solution-first thinking:** Falling in love with solution before validating problem
3. **Fake validation:** Counting "that's cool" as validation (it's not)
4. **Too broad ICP:** "Everyone" is not a customer segment
5. **Skipping competition:** Assuming no competition means opportunity
6. **Ignoring timing:** Good idea at wrong time = failed startup
7. **No design partners:** Building before anyone commits to use it
8. **Vanity validation:** Surveys instead of real conversations
