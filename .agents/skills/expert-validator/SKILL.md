# Expert Validator - Expert Secrets Scorecard

Assess positioning, authority, and messaging against Expert Secrets principles. Expose weak positioning that makes people look like everyone else.

**Brunson's Principle:** "You don't need to be the most qualified—you need to be the most positioned."

## When This Activates

- User asks "validate my positioning"
- User asks "is my messaging right"
- User says "I sound like everyone else"
- User asks "how do I build authority"
- User asks "what's my angle"

## The Framework

```
Attractive Character → Epiphany Bridge → Big Domino → New Opportunity
```

## Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Attractive Character | 2x | Is there a compelling persona/story? |
| Origin Story | 1.5x | Is there a powerful epiphany bridge? |
| Big Domino | 2x | Is there one core belief to shift? |
| New Opportunity | 1.5x | Is it framed as new vs. improvement? |
| Authority Signals | 1x | Are credentials/proof established? |
| Differentiation | 1x | Do they stand out from competitors? |

**Max Score:** 100 points

## Rating Scale

| Score | Rating | Verdict |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 85-100 | Expert Positioned | Refine and scale |
| 70-84 | Good Foundation | Strengthen weak areas |
| 55-69 | Needs Work | Clarify before scaling |
| 40-54 | Commodity Zone | Major repositioning needed |
| 0-39 | Invisible | Start from scratch |

## Quick Reference

### Attractive Character Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Leader | "Follow me, I'll show you" | Coaches, gurus |
| Adventurer | "Join me on this journey" | Explorers, testers |
| Reporter | "I researched this for you" | Curators, analysts |
| Reluctant Hero | "I didn't want to, but..." | Accidental experts |

### Big Domino Formula

```
"If I can get them to believe [ONE THING], then all other objections become irrelevant."
```

### New Opportunity vs. Improvement

| Improvement (Weak) | New Opportunity (Strong) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| "Better marketing" | "A new way to get customers" |
| "Faster results" | "A different approach entirely" |
| "We're like X but better" | "Skip the old method" |
