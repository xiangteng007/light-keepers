>
> 1. Who are you and what do you help people do?
> 2. What's your background/origin story?
> 3. What makes you different from competitors?
> 4. What's the main thing you want people to believe?
> 5. How do you describe what you offer?
> 6. Share any positioning materials (bio, about page, pitch)

## Scoring Criteria

### Attractive Character (0-10, Weight: 2x)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Vivid, memorable character with clear archetype and personality |
| 7-8 | Good character presence, relatable, some personality |

| Reluctant Hero | "I didn't want to, but..." | Accidental experts |

**Red Flags:**
