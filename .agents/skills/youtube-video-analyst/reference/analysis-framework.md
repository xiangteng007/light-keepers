## Quick Implementation Guide

### To Clone a Viral Formula

1. **Extract the skeleton** - Get the structural framework
2. **Keep the timing** - Match percentage breakdowns
3. **Steal the hooks** - Adapt exact patterns
4. **Match the energy** - Follow pacing rhythm
5. **Use the loops** - Apply same retention techniques
6. **Mirror the arc** - Follow emotional journey

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Copying words instead of patterns
- Ignoring pacing/timing
- Skipping the hook stack
- Weak open loops
- No payoff points
- Generic CTAs
